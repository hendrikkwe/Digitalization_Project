This relates predominantly to real estate loans, which are not relevant for this distinction. In spring 2022, the European Commission expanded the EU taxonomy to include economic ac tivities in the nuclear and gas sectors.

Physical risks, on the other hand, develop as a result of changing climatic conditions and the associated more extreme and more frequent acute weather events, such as floods, or chronic effects, such as rising sea levels.

As a major financier of the German economy, we are also active in sectors that are particularly exposed to climate-related physical or transition risks. However, we ha ve little exposure to some of the hardest-hit sectors (agriculture, for example).

While physical biodiversity risks arise from a loss or degradation of things provided by the ecosystem on which the economic system depends (e.g. pollination or genetic diversity), transition risks in this context refer to risks that arise from the transformation process towards a more sustainable and environmentally friendly economy.

As a result, we currently assess physical biodiversity risks as not material, but consid er transition risks to be material risk drivers for credit risk in the medium and long term. It can be assumed that biodiversity risks will tend to increase with time.
