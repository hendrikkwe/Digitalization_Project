In the case of climate and environmental risk s, it is therefore useful to distinguish between local and suprare- gional events and market -wide or sector -specific effects. DekaBank's specific exposure therefore depends, among other things, on the current portfolio, the macroeconomic environ- ment and the specific climate and environmental event.

The analyses of the risk inventory in the year under review have shown, as described, that the effects of climate and envi- ronmental risks are predominantly classifi ed as not significant in the time horizon considered for the main risk types.

Long -term developments have no noticeable effects in the regular controlling processes or are already priced in.

Such risks can be mini- mised by observing international standards, e.g. the Equator Principles. These aspects are discussed in chapters 4.1.2. “Sus- tainability in lending” and 5.1. “Regulations and standards”.
