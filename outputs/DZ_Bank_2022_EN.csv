16;DZ_Bank_2022_EN;4;0;;;;;;;;;;;Dear reader, 2022 was largely shaped by the lingering effects of the pandemic and Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, an event that has caused unimaginable suf- fering. Yet even – or perhaps especially – in this geopolitical climate, the development of our economy and society toward greater sustainability is of crucial importance. Within the DZ BANK Group, we recognize the need for change and the opportunities that this could bring.
17;DZ_Bank_2022_EN;4;0;;;;;;;;;;;The Paris climate action targets and the United Nations’ sustainable development goals show us the way. DZ BANK aims to work with our customers to support the transformation of the econ- omy toward greater sustainability. We are actively working on solutions to bring our portfolio into line with the 1.5 °C target and the vision of a ’net- zero future’. This is illustrated in our business through figures: Loan commitments in the area of renewable energies grew in 2022 to around €6.5 billion.
18;DZ_Bank_2022_EN;4;0;;;;;;;;;;;In the capital markets, we supported placements of green, social, sustainability, and sustainability-linked bonds with a total volume of more than €43.4 bil- lion. In funds business, Union Investment is one of the market leaders with €122.4 billion of sustainable assets under management in accordance with the EU Sustainable Finance Disclosure Regulation (SFDR).
19;DZ_Bank_2022_EN;4;0;;;;;;;;;;;And in the case of R+V’s unit-linked life insurance and pension insurance policies, the pro- portion of new business in funds classified as sustainable pursuant to SFDR amounted to around 63 percent in 2022.2.0 Foreword Uwe Fröhlich (left) and Dr. Cornelius Riese, Co-Chief Executive Officers | | | | | | | |Contents Company profile Strategy Corporate management Business portfolio Business processes Employees Corporate citizenship Annex4 DZ BANK 2022 Sustainability Report 4.
20;DZ_Bank_2022_EN;5;0;;;;;;;;;;;We will continue translating our shared values and our sustainability goals into action and reporting on the results. This report provides a compre- hensive insight into our sustainability activities in 2022. This year, for the first time, we have also had the highlighted disclosures of the Principles for Responsible Banking Index (UN PRB) independently reviewed. We hope that you will enjoy reading this report and we look forward to con- tinuing our dialogue with you.
21;DZ_Bank_2022_EN;5;0;;;;;;;;;;;Kind regards, The Co-Chief Executive Officers of DZ BANK Uwe Fröhlich Dr. Cornelius Riese Co-Chief Executive Officer Co-Chief Executive OfficerTo ensure an effective approach to this work, we set up the Group Sustain- ability Committee on January 1, 2023 as a steering committee at the level of the Board of Managing Directors of the DZ BANK Group. We have set ambitious new sustainability objectives and created sector-specific decarbon- ization pathways.
22;DZ_Bank_2022_EN;5;0;;;;;;;;;;;The results show that DZ BANK is starting from a good position in key emissions-intensive sectors, with relatively carbon-efficient portfolios. Climate risks are also financial risks. That is one of the reasons why we signed up to the recommendations of the Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures (TCFD) last year, as they help to create greater transpar - ency in dealing with these risks. It is important to us to be transparent about what we do.

25;DZ_Bank_2022_EN;6;0;;;;;;;;;;;The DZ BANK Group is one of the leading financial services providers in Germany and is part of the Volksbanken Raif- feisenbanken cooperative financial network. Strategy Sustainability is firmly embedded in the business model of the DZ BANK Group as a value and a strategic goal. Its entities have committed to the principles of the United Nations Global Compact and support its sustainable devel- opment goals (SDGs), agreed in 2015.
26;DZ_Bank_2022_EN;6;0;;;;;;;;;;;"Depending on their particular line of business, the entities have also signed up to the UN Principles for Responsible Investment, Responsible Banking, or Sustainable Insurance . The group’s corporate strategy supports the transformation of the economy to a future that is compatible with the 1.5 degree target. In 2022, DZ BANK became a supporter of the Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures (TCFD); Union Invest- ment has been a supporter since 2018."
27;DZ_Bank_2022_EN;6;0;;;;;;;;;;;A materiality assess- ment was carried out in order to determine key areas of action for sustainability activities. Corporate governance The Group Governance Policy sets the standards for good and responsible corporate governance. This includes ensur - ing legally compliant action as described in the DZ BANK Group’s code of conduct , and a functioning system of risk management that includes sustainability risks.
28;DZ_Bank_2022_EN;6;0;;;;;;;;;;;The Group Coordination Committee , the Group’s most senior steering committee, is responsible for coordinating sustainability activities across the Group. Since January 2023, the Group Sustainability Committee (GSC) at the level of the Board of Managing Directors has provided a platform for the sharing of information across the Group, with the aim of integrating sustainability even more closely into the core business.
29;DZ_Bank_2022_EN;6;0;;;;;;;;;;;With this purpose in mind, an integrated umbrella program was launched in early 2022. Some of the individual projects that form part of the program involve collaboration between dif- ferent Group entities. Business portfolio Key objectives of the DZ BANK Group for the core business include lasting impact within the meaning of the SDGs, the decarbonization of the credit portfolio, and the manage ment of climate risks.
30;DZ_Bank_2022_EN;6;0;;;;;;;;;;;To implement these objectives, DZ BANK created its own SDG classification approach for assessing its business activities in 2020. In 2022, sector-specific decarbon- ization targets were developed for use in lending and invest- ment. DZ BANK follows the standards of the Partnership for Carbon Accounting for Financials (PCAF) and the method- ology of the Paris Agreement Capital Transition Assessment (PACTA) when calculating the absolute funded emissions.
31;DZ_Bank_2022_EN;6;0;;;;;;;;;;;These approaches supplement the long-established rejection criteria and sectoral rules . The DZ BANK banking group and R+V Versicherung have been making detailed disclosures under the EU taxonomy since 2021. The asset management companies also make disclosures on the share of sustainable fund products in accordance with the SFDR . Business processes Customer focus is a core commitment for all entities in the DZ BANK Group.
32;DZ_Bank_2022_EN;6;1;;;;;;;;;;;For some of them, this also includes protecting customers against overextending themselves financially. The entities have an environmental management policy and pursue a shared climate strategy to reduce their greenhouse gas emissions. Data protection and information security are governed by groupwide policies .
33;DZ_Bank_2022_EN;6;1;;;;;;;;;;;Employees Attracting, retaining, and developing employees is the focus of the groupwide HR strategy , which also includes a com- mon remuneration and employer branding strategy , and a shared understanding of leadership . In a letter of intent pub- lished in 2012, the group entities committed to supporting the advancement of women in their careers.
34;DZ_Bank_2022_EN;6;1;;;;;;;;;;;Corporate citizenship The DZ BANK Group entities engage in a wide variety of corporate citizenship activities, including the promotion of financial literacy. Many have set up foundations to make a lasting contribution to social development, and all make donations to social and cultural causes. In 2022, the focus across the group was on aid for Ukraine.3.

46;DZ_Bank_2022_EN;9;0;;;;;;;;;;;5.0 Strategy Firm focus Sustainability is firmly embedded in the corporate values and strategy of the DZ BANK Group. We incorporate the sustainable development goals and the Paris climate agreement into our core business and our finance function.
47;DZ_Bank_2022_EN;10;0;;;;;;;;;;;Sustainability is embedded in the strategy of the DZ BANK Group at several different levels: as a priority topic for the strategic planning process, as a groupwide area of potential, and as a self-contained implementation package under the ’Verbund First 4.0’ initiative of DZ BANK. Sustainability in the strategic planning process As part of the annual strategic planning process (SPP), the group entities define their business strategy including the strategic direction, objectives, and measures.
48;DZ_Bank_2022_EN;10;0;;;;;;;;;;;These plans are discussed in strategic dialogue sessions at the level of the Board of Managing Directors and then taken forward to the consolidated group planning stage, which involves the devel- opment of the business strategy for the DZ BANK Group. The Strategy & Group Development division of DZ BANK is responsible for the overall coordination of the SPP .
49;DZ_Bank_2022_EN;10;0;;;;;;;;;;;Sustain- ability has to be treated as a key topic in all strategic dia- logues within the DZ BANK Group and evaluated against the backdrop of the changing regulatory and market conditions. The subject is discussed in terms of opportunities and risks.
50;DZ_Bank_2022_EN;10;0;;;;;;;;;;;The strategic positioning of the overall bank and the role of the divisions in supporting customers’ transformation was discussed at DZ BANK in 2022 as part of the strategic dia- logues with the Corporate Banking, Capital Markets, and Transaction Banking business lines. In 2022, the SPP was also used to identify the key sustainability issues applicable to each of the group entities, as the priorities vary according to business model.
51;DZ_Bank_2022_EN;10;0;;;;;;;;;;;For example, DZ BANK plans to further expand its sustainability expertise and environmental, social, and corporate governance (ESG) activities in its capital mar - kets business with institutional clients. The range of sustain- able investment products on offer in the securities business with retail customers is also to be extended.
52;DZ_Bank_2022_EN;10;0;;;;;;;;;;;Union Investment aims to support the sustainability efforts of clients in its institutional asset management business and continues to expand its product range with a focus on sus- tainability-oriented institutional mutual funds. In addition, it intends to broaden its offering of sustainability-oriented products for retail customers. DZ PRIVATBANK also offers various solutions for sustainability-minded customers.
53;DZ_Bank_2022_EN;10;0;;;;;;;;;;;Going forward, it wants to increase the extent to which sustainabil- ity factors are taken into account in its asset management activities and integrate these factors more tightly into selec- tion processes. Sustainability as an area of potential in the DZ BANK Group strategy Sustainability is one of currently seven areas of potential that are to be used to further strengthen the future com- petitiveness and profitability of the DZ BANK Group.
54;DZ_Bank_2022_EN;10;0;;;;;;;;;;;These areas of potential are being coordinated at group level by the Strategy & Group Development division of DZ BANK for the purposes of the SPP . This area of potential is being spon- sored by the two Co-Chief Executive Officers of DZ BANK AG along with members of the Boards of Managing Direc- tors of DZ BANK Group entities representing other areas of the financial sector (Union Investment for asset man- agement and R+V for insurance).
55;DZ_Bank_2022_EN;10;0;;;;;;;;;;;The Group Coordination Committee, the highest-level management and coordination committee in the DZ BANK Group, is updated regularly on progress with the implementation of measures in the areas of potential. ( › section 6.1 Governance ). In 2020, the 17 sustainable development goals (SDGs) of the United Nations (UN) were determined as the overarching classification framework for the business activities of the DZ BANK Group entities.
56;DZ_Bank_2022_EN;10;1;;;;;;;;;;;This is consistent with the objectives of the cooperative financial network, which regards the SDGs as a core component of its sustainability strategy. DZ BANK has developed a proprietary SDG classification method for analyzing business activities in respect of their contribution to the 17 SDGs. The plan is to make SDG classification avail- able to the entire cooperative financial network ( › section 7.1 Impact transparency ).
57;DZ_Bank_2022_EN;10;1;;;;;;;;;;;The work in the sustainability area of potential in 2022 focused on transforming the Group Corporate Responsibil- ity Committee (GCRC) – the group’s existing committee for sustainability matters, whose members are drawn from the operating business – into a Group Sustainability Committee (GSC) at the level of the Board of Managing Directors. It will become operational in 2023 ( › section 6.1 Governance ). Verbund First 4.0 initiative of DZ BANK The ’Verbund First 4.

59;DZ_Bank_2022_EN;11;0;;;;;;;;;;;The ESG goals will continue to be updated. The targets and the results achieved as at December 31, 2022 are shown in the overview of ESG goals on the next page. This over - view also contains the new ESG goals defined in 2022 with respect to climate alignment and decarbonization, employee satisfaction, and women in managerial positions.
60;DZ_Bank_2022_EN;11;0;;;;;;;;;;;To provide structure, each goal will be assigned to one of four dimen- sions going forward: environment (E), social (S), corporate governance (G), and ESG in general. In 2022, DZ BANK set itself the goal of managing its busi- ness portfolios in accordance with the Paris climate agree- ment (environment dimension).
61;DZ_Bank_2022_EN;11;0;;;;;;;;;;;This requires it to measure and report on greenhouse gas emissions intensity in the economic sectors that are relevant to decarbonization (’focus sectors’) and manage them using sector-specific goals. In 2022, sector sprints were conducted to develop roadmaps for reduction ( › section 7.1 Impact transparency, sub-section Climate alignment ). A new goal in the social dimension is ensuring lasting employee satisfaction.
62;DZ_Bank_2022_EN;11;0;;;;;;;;;;;DZ BANK has set itself the goal of maintaining its OCI (Organizational Commitment Index) score, measured by the annual staff surveys, at 70 percent or above. In the corporate governance dimension, the DZ BANK Group wants to increase the proportion of women on the Boards of Managing Directors across the group to 30 percent by 2030. On December 31, 2022, the share was 22.9 percent.The ESG goals were achieved in 2022.
63;DZ_Bank_2022_EN;11;0;;;;;;;;;;;Financial services pro- vider MSCI confirmed DZ BANK’s MSCI ESG Research rating of AA (on a scale from AAA to CCC). The DZ BANK Group’s ‘prime’ rating from sustainability rating agency ISS ESG continues to apply. It is also on schedule with reducing the aggregate carbon emissions of its operations. DZ BANK made good progress toward achieving its goals in relation to the business portfolio. For example, the lend- ing volume in the field of renewable energies increased to €6.
64;DZ_Bank_2022_EN;11;0;;;;;;;;;;;48 billion as at December 31, 2022, which was substan- tially higher than the target figure of €6 billion ( › section 7.4.3 Lending ).The proportion of the lending volume that generated a positive impact on the UN SDGs in DZ BANK’s corporate banking business increased to 66 percent (up from 65 percent in 2021) ( › section 7.1 Impact transparency ) and was therefore only slightly below the target of two- thirds.
65;DZ_Bank_2022_EN;11;1;;;;;;;;;;;The volume of assets invested by Union Investment in accordance with the requirements of articles 8 and 9 of the EU Sustainable Finance Disclosure Regulation (SFDR) rose to €122.4 billion by the end of 2022 (December 31, 2021: €125.6 billion). Of this, €81.2 billion (target: €81 billion) was invested sustainably in accordance with the minimum ESG requirements that Union Investment has set for itself ( › sec- tion 7.5 Asset management ).
66;DZ_Bank_2022_EN;11;1;;;;;;;;;;;"iarity, decentralization, regional market responsibility, and sustainability are the central principles of the strategy. The strategic program, which is designed to ensure DZ BANK’s resilience for the future, focuses on improving the market offering, control and production processes, and the cor - porate culture. In 2022, its implementation was structured in 23 implementation packages; one package is dedicated specifically to sustainability topics."
67;DZ_Bank_2022_EN;11;1;;;;;;;;;;;The aims include satis- fying regulatory requirements relating to sustainability, cre- ating transparency in order to provide a basis for strategic decisions about the future focus of sustainability activities, and continually improving the coordination of sustainability activities between DZ BANK, the other management units of the DZ BANK Group, and other partners of the coop- erative financial network, including the Bundesverband der Deutschen Volksbanken und Raiffeisenbanken (BVR) [National.

77;DZ_Bank_2022_EN;13;0;;;;;;;;;;;As well as being committed to the PRB, DZ BANK is involved in other initiatives and working groups at national and international level aimed at helping to stem climate change. DZ BANK is a member of the Net Zero Banking Alliance Ger - many (NZBAG), a coalition of eight German financial insti- tutions led by the Frankfurt-based Green and Sustainable Finance Cluster, and has undertaken to manage its lending and investment portfolios in accordance with the targets of the Paris climate agreement.
78;DZ_Bank_2022_EN;13;0;;;;;;;;;;;It is underpinned by the voluntary climate commitment of the German finance indus- try, which DZ BANK signed in 2021. The signatories report on their progress on the voluntary climate commitment website (for DZ BANK › section 5.1 Strategy and goals, sub-section ESG goals and › section 7.1 Impact transparency, sub-section climate alignment ).

87;DZ_Bank_2022_EN;14;0;;;;;;;;;;;The sustainability guidelines developed by and for the Volks- banken Raiffeisenbanken cooperative financial network in 2020 provide a framework for all of its sustainability activities. They state that the cooperative financial network derives its strength from shared cooperative roots and val- ues – such as solidarity, partnership, and trust – and from an open and transparent culture.
88;DZ_Bank_2022_EN;14;0;;;;;;;;;;;The idea of forming cooperatives to benefit from collective protection against risks and create a link between financial success and social welfare has been around for more than 170 years, and yet, it has never been more relevant. Coop- eratives operate in a sustainable and responsible manner. They help to put innovative ideas into practice, support their members, and are firmly rooted in their region.
89;DZ_Bank_2022_EN;14;0;;;;;;;;;;;The cooper - ative financial network’s sustainability guidelines highlight the positive impact of cooperative practices on society in the context of the current challenges of sustainable develop- ment and complement the existing body of corporate values that the group entities uphold. This body of values includes the groupwide code of conduct, which requires all execu- tives and employees of the DZ BANK Group to act in compli- ance with the law and ethical standards.
90;DZ_Bank_2022_EN;14;0;;;;;;;;;;;In 2019, DZ BANK defined eight values that serve as guid- ing principles for the further development of its corporate culture. These include innovation, consistency, performance, courage, partnership, security, cosmopolitanism, and also sustainability as a hallmark of long-term thinking and responsible conduct. Upholding these values means always taking the consequences for the bank and its environment into consideration when making decisions.
91;DZ_Bank_2022_EN;14;0;;;;;;;;;;;Most group entities also have their own corporate principles and values that are typically rooted in the cooperative values and take account of sustainability. Further details can be found in the sustainability reports and on the websites of the individual group entities.5.2 Vision and cooperative values Groupwide code of conduct requires all executives and employees to act in compliance with the law and ethical standards.

93;DZ_Bank_2022_EN;15;0;;;;;;;;;;;A materiality assessment was conducted in 2021 in collab- oration with the group entities in order to determine topics of material importance for the sustainability reporting of the DZ BANK Group. This assessment focused on the criteria ‘relevance to the business’ and ‘impact on the environment, people, and society’, as required under section 289c HGB, and on the relevance of topics to stakeholders.
94;DZ_Bank_2022_EN;15;0;;;;;;;;;;;The first step of the materiality assessment was the prepa- ration of a list of 18 potentially material topics. This shortlist was created on the basis of an analysis of various sources such as internal meeting minutes, the results of the 2020 materiality assessment, discussions with church banks, and requirements of rating agencies and non-governmental organizations (NGOs).
95;DZ_Bank_2022_EN;15;0;;;;;;;;;;;A three-step process was then used to assess the potentially material topics based on the afore- mentioned criteria: Stakeholder relevance: To assess this aspect, an online survey was conducted among stakeholders of the group entities in which a total of 1,049 representatives of different stakeholder groups (employees, retail customers, corporate customers, suppliers, service providers, investors, rating agencies, policymakers, NGOs, academia) participated.
96;DZ_Bank_2022_EN;15;0;;;;;;;;;;;Impact: The assessment of the impact that business activ- ities have on the environment, people, and society in con- nection with the individual topics was discussed and deter - mined by the sustainability coordinators of the group entities during a workshop.
97;DZ_Bank_2022_EN;15;0;;;;;;;;;;;Relevance to the business: Sustainability experts from DZ BANK’s Strategy & Group Development division conducted a workshop during which they assessed the relevance of the topics to the proper understanding of the business perfor - mance, results, and position of the DZ BANK Group and vali- dated the outcomes of the previous two steps of the process.
98;DZ_Bank_2022_EN;15;0;;;;;;;;;;;The analysis found that ten of the topics are material pur - suant to section 289c HGB because they are relevant or highly relevant to the business and because business activ- ities relating to them have a medium to high impact on the environment, people, and society. Three further topics (management of environmental and climate factors in oper - ations, work-life balance, occupational health and safety) are material only under the GRI standards.
99;DZ_Bank_2022_EN;15;0;;;;;;;;;;;This is because these topics have a high impact but are not highly relevant to the business. Five topics (corporate citizenship, financial literacy, public policy, sustainable supplier management, and per - formance-based remuneration and codetermination) were found to be of medium to low relevance in all dimensions.
100;DZ_Bank_2022_EN;15;0;;;;;;;;;;;In 2022, DZ BANK’s Strategy & Group Development division reviewed the results of the 2021 groupwide materiality assessment in light of the latest developments and con- firmed that it was still valid for the reporting year. The following therefore applies to this report: – The presentation of the management concepts for the ten topics that are material pursuant to section 289c HGB takes a groupwide approach and is partly based on the GRI standards.
101;DZ_Bank_2022_EN;15;0;;;;;;;;;;;It makes up the non-financial report, which constitutes the core of this Sustainability Report. It is supplemented with information on corporate manage- ment/governance, the sustainability strategy and sustain- ability organization, risk management, the dialogue with stakeholders, the human resources strategy, and human rights because these aspects are relevant to the manage- ment of the DZ BANK Group irrespective of the results of the materiality assessment.
102;DZ_Bank_2022_EN;15;0;;;;;;;;;;;Information from the non- financial report is presented with a gray background. –The reporting on the three topics that are material under the GRI standards focuses primarily on DZ BANK because this report also functions as DZ BANK’s GRI sustainability report. Nonetheless, management approaches, consoli- dated key figures, and examples from other group entities are also provided in order to offer the reader a holistic view of sustainability in the DZ BANK Group.
103;DZ_Bank_2022_EN;15;0;;;;;;;;;;;–Five further topics are included on an entirely voluntary basis, focusing mainly on DZ BANK, in order to provide as comprehensive a picture of sustainability activities as possible.

168;DZ_Bank_2022_EN;24;0;;;;;;;;;;;Ensuring compliance is essential to responsible corporate governance. An effective compliance management system ensures that business practices are legitimate and serves to protect against reputational risks and financial loss. This includes combating corruption and bribery, preventing money laundering, the financing of terrorism, market manip- ulation, and insider trading, and ensuring compliance with financial sanctions.
169;DZ_Bank_2022_EN;24;0;;;;;;;;;;;Compliance management is therefore crucial to the integrity of the financial system and underpins both economic growth and social stability. 6.2.1 Compliance function All entities in the DZ BANK Group that are required by law or regulation to establish a compliance function have done so. The main tasks of this function are to identify, manage, and mitigate compliance risk in order to protect the entity and its employees and customers against breaches of legal provisions and requirements.
170;DZ_Bank_2022_EN;24;0;;;;;;;;;;;The compliance function is also responsible for monitoring compliance with the legal provisions and requirements. The compliance framework of the DZ BANK Group comprises a compliance policy, which sets out the requirements for the establishment/organization of the compliance functions and details of their duties, and compliance standards to guide the operational implementa- tion of these requirements.
171;DZ_Bank_2022_EN;24;0;;;;;;;;;;;The core principles are also laid down in the DZ BANK Group’s code of conduct, which was published at the end of 2022.At DZ BANK, the compliance function ensures that effective procedures for complying with the legal regulations and requirements that are material to the bank are implemented and the relevant controls are carried out.
172;DZ_Bank_2022_EN;24;0;;;;;;;;;;;The areas of responsibility of the Compliance division include anti-money laundering and fraud prevention, capital market compliance and corporate compliance, and the MaRisk compliance func- tion. The data protection officers and their staff are also part of the Compliance division. The capital market compliance team is responsible for advis- ing the departments of DZ BANK on national and European regulatory requirements and for ensuring compliance with all securities regulations.
173;DZ_Bank_2022_EN;24;0;;;;;;;;;;;The capital market compliance employees also monitor the departments, prepare internal policies, and train employees on relevant national and Euro- pean provisions. The MaRisk and group compliance team is responsible for all aspects of compliance governance at the level of the DZ BANK Group.
174;DZ_Bank_2022_EN;24;0;;;;;;;;;;;It also advises departments, branches, and group entities with regard to the implementation of these requirements, monitors adherence to the compliance frame- work, and carries out compliance risk analysis at DZ BANK. The MaRisk and group compliance team is furthermore responsible for implementing and monitoring legal standards at DZ BANK. The ’Central Inventory of Laws and Regula- tions‘ has been created for this purpose for the DZ BANK Group, as part of the compliance framework.
175;DZ_Bank_2022_EN;24;1;;;;;;;;;;;Once per year, and on an ad hoc basis as required, the Com- pliance division of DZ BANK reports to the Board of Manag- ing Directors on the activities of the compliance functions of all group entities and describes any material insights they have gained.
176;DZ_Bank_2022_EN;24;1;;;;;;;;;;;The tasks of the Compliance division are based on the requirements of the German Banking Act (MaRisk, money laundering, and criminal offenses), the German Secu- rities Trading Act (MaComp), the Market Abuse Regulation (MAR), the Market Abuse Directive (MAD), the German Anti- Money Laundering Act (GwG), and the corresponding leg- islation at European level.
177;DZ_Bank_2022_EN;24;1;;;;;;;;;;;In addition to this annual compli- ance report, the Compliance division also carries out a sepa- rate risk assessment each year for the member of the Board of Managing Directors with responsibility for compliance, entitled ‘Prevention of money laundering, terrorist financing, and criminal offenses’.
178;DZ_Bank_2022_EN;24;1;;;;;;;;;;;The reports and analyses go hand in hand with an ongoing review and further development of the preventive measures implemented within the DZ BANK Group to prevent money laundering, financing of terrorism, and criminal offenses. All group entities have established a whistleblowing system that enables employees to report compliance breaches anon- ymously and thus protect themselves against disciplinary measures or other action.
179;DZ_Bank_2022_EN;24;1;;;;;;;;;;;The ombudspersons appointed in six group entities, to whom breaches can also be reported, are bound by confidentiality in order to protect whistleblow- ers.

The committee evaluates the infor - mation and swiftly initiates any required action, including the involvement of investigating authorities where necessary. DZ BANK received eight reports in 2022 and further action was taken in seven of them. One report was submitted by the group entities that led to further action.
181;DZ_Bank_2022_EN;25;0;;;;;;;;;;;In order to ensure good business practices, DZ BANK pro- vides regular training for its employees on compliance, pre- vention of money laundering and terrorist financing, finan- cial sanctions and embargoes, fraud prevention, the General Data Protection Regulation, information security, and pre- vention of market manipulation. Regular training on occupa- tional health and safety and outsourcing is also provided.
182;DZ_Bank_2022_EN;25;0;;;;;;;;;;;Web-based programs are used for this training and include a mandatory test for employees at the end. Employees must complete these programs soon after joining the orga- nization. Follow-up courses have to be completed every two years. Employees who fail to participate in the training receive an automated reminder to complete the program within the next 15 days.
183;DZ_Bank_2022_EN;25;0;;;;;;;;;;;The internal reminder system for training modules consists of a total of three warning levels, each of which also sends a notification to the employee’s immediate line manager. Every division of DZ BANK has appointed someone to deal with fraud prevention.
184;DZ_Bank_2022_EN;25;0;;;;;;;;;;;This person ensures, in collaboration In addition, standardized guidelines that are designed to prevent money laundering and fraud within the DZ BANK Group are developed and documented in writing as part of the compliance policy for the DZ BANK Group and the asso- ciated compliance standards. The group entities are moni- tored to ensure that they comply with the guidelines relating to anti-money laundering and fraud prevention.
185;DZ_Bank_2022_EN;25;0;;;;;;;;;;;A central point of contact has been established in the DZ BANK Com- pliance division in order to bring together all information concerning anti-money laundering and fraud prevention. At DZ BANK and other group entities, employees and third parties (such as customers, suppliers, and external staff) can submit a report using the whistleblowing system or contact an internal or external ombudsperson if they wish to flag up potentially illegal or damaging practices.
186;DZ_Bank_2022_EN;25;0;;;;;;;;;;;"This mechanism can be used to report suspected inappropriate behavior of employees in a business context as well as suspicions about the violation of laws, sanctions, or embargoes by customers. The information received by the ombudsperson is passed ing for employees; the proportion of employees undergoing such training in the entities ranges from 97 to 100 percent. 6.2."
187;DZ_Bank_2022_EN;25;1;;;;;;;;;;;2 Prevention of money laundering and fraud By signing up to the UN Global Compact, the DZ BANK Group has undertaken to respect and comply with the ten principles of corporate responsibility. This includes taking decisive action against corruption in all its forms, including extortion, bribery, and passive corruption. The DZ BANK Group’s code of conduct is based on the principles of the UN Global Compact.
188;DZ_Bank_2022_EN;25;1;;;;;;;;;;;It also addresses undesirable business practices and makes reference to various fraud prevention tools. Supplementary policies for dealing with gifts have been adopted by all DZ BANK Group entities. Rules for deal- ing with gifts and hospitality are contained in the group’s ‘Acceptance and Granting of Benefits’ policy.
189;DZ_Bank_2022_EN;25;1;;;;;;;;;;;In the context of anti-money laundering and fraud preven- tion at DZ BANK, a central function develops and imple- ments safeguards against money laundering, the financing of terrorism, and other criminal offenses. These include implementing the German Anti-Money Laundering Act and other legislation relevant to money laundering at DZ BANK, including the foreign branches, and formulating and mon- itoring rules aimed at preventing criminal offenses at the bank.

In 2022, no group entity became aware of fines or sanctions imposed due to non-compliance with environmental legislation. 6.2.4 Taxes Under its overall strategy, the DZ BANK Group has for - mulated a tax strategy that characterizes compliance with applicable tax obligations as part of its corporate responsi- bility. The strategy serves as a policy and an expression of values and principles for all entities in the DZ BANK Group.
192;DZ_Bank_2022_EN;26;0;;;;;;;;;;;The principles laid down in the strategy also form part of the group’s code of conduct. The tax strategy is reviewed regularly, at least once per year, to assess if any updates are required, and is approved by the Group Risk and Finance Committee. Responsibility for tax compliance lies with the Board of Managing Directors of the relevant group entity.
193;DZ_Bank_2022_EN;26;0;;;;;;;;;;;As a legal entity whose headquarters and management are based in Germany, DZ BANK is liable to pay tax on its entire worldwide income in Germany without limitation. In addi- tion, it has limited tax liability in respect of its international branches and their local income.
194;DZ_Bank_2022_EN;26;0;;;;;;;;;;;DZ BANK believes in the principles of paying taxes on profits at the place where the associated economic value is generated in accordance with international transfer pricing guidelines, always duly fulfilling its tax obligations, and complying with national and inter - national tax laws at all times. Furthermore, DZ BANK rejects inappropriate legal structuring practices and tax evasion and that examines all trades for market manipulation.
195;DZ_Bank_2022_EN;26;0;;;;;;;;;;;Moreover, a multi-level process within DZ BANK is designed to ensure that employees adhere to the statutory requirements aimed at preventing insider trading. A dedicated policy governs the handling of gifts and prevents bribery. As the central institution, DZ BANK manages international payments for many of the local cooperative banks.
196;DZ_Bank_2022_EN;26;0;;;;;;;;;;;It there- fore falls within its remit to detect suspicious transactions in this context and to report them to Germany’s central agency for analyzing financial transactions, the Financial Intelligence Unit (FIU). Union Investment began to implement a new money laun- dering prevention system in 2022, primarily with the aim of digitalizing anti-money laundering measures and the moni- toring of sanctions. 6.2.
197;DZ_Bank_2022_EN;26;1;;;;;;;;;;;3 Socioeconomic and environmental aspects The Compliance division of DZ BANK did not identify any incidents of corruption in the DZ BANK Group in 2022. There were also no incidents or lawsuits filed in relation to anti-competitive behavior, anti-trust practices, and monopoly practices during the reporting period. For all entities in the DZ BANK Group, complying with environmental laws and legislation is a matter of course.

The processes for accepting customers and updating customer data on an ongoing basis have been defined in writing by DZ BANK in accordance with statutory requirements. A risk-based approach ensures that all necessary data and information about the bank’s customers is collected.
199;DZ_Bank_2022_EN;26;1;;;;;;;;;;;This also includes checks to identify politically exposed persons (PEPs) and checks against sanc- tion and embargo lists. Since 2020, processes for accepting customers and updating customer data have been supported by the electronic GPdirekt system. All sites and group entities are included in the annual com- pliance risk analysis, which is required by law and aimed at preventing money laundering, the financing of terrorism, and other criminal offenses.
200;DZ_Bank_2022_EN;26;1;;;;;;;;;;;No significant risks were identi- fied in the analysis in 2022. At DZ BANK, the rules for the handling of potential con- flicts of interest are set out in a dedicated policy. The bank informs customers of possible conflicts of interest and inducements, for example in cases where the supply of financial analyses coincides with the provision of banking services. Initiating and monitoring the implementation of such measures falls within the remit of the Compliance division.

It defines the company-wide framework for risk appetite and risk-bearing capacity, as well as the risk man- agement goals and measures to achieve these.
214;DZ_Bank_2022_EN;28;0;;;;;;;;;;;The objective of the risk strategies adopted by DZ BANK’s Board of Managing Directors for all activities is that risk should be taken on only to the extent necessary to achieve business objectives and only where there is an adequate understanding of the risks and the necessary expertise to measure and manage them. The group entities’ compliance with the risk strategies is monitored on an ongoing basis.
215;DZ_Bank_2022_EN;28;0;;;;;;;;;;;The Board of Managing Directors receives frequent updates on the general risk situation in connection with the defined risk appetite, primarily in the form of a monthly overall risk The objectives of the DZ BANK Group’s risk management system are to identify risks at an early stage, assess their financial implications, and implement measures to avoid or mitigate these risks.
216;DZ_Bank_2022_EN;28;0;;;;;;;;;;;In this context, sustainability risks that impact on the business activities of the group entities are becoming increasingly important. For example, climate-re- lated and environmental, social, and corporate governance risks (ESG risks) have been identified as material overarching factors that pose predominantly medium-term and long- term risks to the DZ BANK Group. The focus is currently on climate-related and environmental risks resulting from climate change.
217;DZ_Bank_2022_EN;28;1;;;;;;;;;;;These risks comprise both physical risks, such as more occurrences of natural disasters and floods, and transition risks, which can arise particularly as a result of legislative initiatives and changes in consumer behavior (see the risk report included in the 2022 group management report of the DZ BANK Group and in the 2022 management report of DZ BANK AG ).
218;DZ_Bank_2022_EN;28;1;;;;;;;;;;;Based on regulatory recommendations such as the Guidance Notice on Dealing with Sustainability Risks issued by BaFin, the DZ BANK Group does not classify sustainability risk as a risk type in its own right. Instead, sustainability-related risks are reflected on the group risk map as facets of established financial and non-financial risk types.
219;DZ_Bank_2022_EN;28;1;;;;;;;;;;;Physical and transition risks from the climate and environmental sphere materialize in areas such as credit risk, reputational risk, operational risk, and actuarial risk.

223;DZ_Bank_2022_EN;29;0;;;;;;;;;;;As part of the annual group risk inventory check conducted by the Group Risk Management & Services division, a survey is carried out among experts in the DZ BANK Group with the aim of promoting transparency and assessing the level of impact of key risk types across the group. The survey is also intended to reveal the impact on the individual busi- ness models.
224;DZ_Bank_2022_EN;29;0;;;;;;;;;;;Since 2021, the group risk inventory check has included an analysis of the ESG risk drivers in order to assess each year which potentially material risk drivers in the climate-related and environmental, social, and corporate governance spheres the DZ BANK Group is exposed to. The analysis was refined and backed up by quantitative data in 2022. Potentially material ESG risk drivers were identified for the risk types credit risk, operational risk, reputational risk, and actuarial risk.

226;DZ_Bank_2022_EN;29;0;;;;;;;;;;;Outside-in perspective Sustainability risks or ESG risks are defined as events or cir - cumstances in the climate-related and environmental, social, or corporate governance spheres that, if they materialized, would definitely or potentially have a significant adverse impact on the financial position and financial performance, liquidity situation, and reputation of a company.
227;DZ_Bank_2022_EN;29;0;;;;;;;;;;;In the envi- ronmental sphere, this typically comprises both physical cli- mate-related and environmental risks – including acute natu- ral and climate disasters such as floods as well as the effects of irreversible climate change – and transition risks (e.g. new statutory requirements or changes to consumer behavior) in connection with the switch to more environmentally sustain- able economic practices with a smaller carbon footprint.
228;DZ_Bank_2022_EN;29;0;;;;;;;;;;;In close collaboration with the relevant departments, the foundations were laid for the efficient management of sus- tainability risk in line with the regulatory requirements of the European Central Bank (ECB) and the European Banking Authority (EBA). This approach will be progressively expanded and defined in greater detail over the coming years.
229;DZ_Bank_2022_EN;29;0;;;;;;;;;;;Inside-out perspective With regard to sustainability-related risks arising from their own business activities, the entities in the DZ BANK Group use various concepts in the lending, financing, and invest- ment business that are designed to minimize potentially adverse sustainability impacts and mitigate potential risks.
230;DZ_Bank_2022_EN;29;0;;;;;;;;;;;These include rejection criteria and sectoral rules, the group credit standard on the consideration of risks associated with ESG factors, and DZ BANK’s sustainability checklist for lend- ing.

They can cause losses in the lending business, for example, if the recoverability of collateral for loan exposures is adversely impacted by climate events.
235;DZ_Bank_2022_EN;30;0;;;;;;;;;;;In addition, as a result of transition effects such as the transition to a climate-neutral economy, there is a risk in the lending business that the profitability of corporate finance borrowers (mainly at DZ BANK) and of real estate finance borrowers (mainly at Bausparkasse Schwäbisch Hall and DZ HYP) could diminish. These effects could lead to a deterioration of the borrowers’ credit quality and thus to higher impairment losses.
236;DZ_Bank_2022_EN;30;0;;;;;;;;;;;In the DZ BANK Group’s Insurance sector, non-life actuarial risk (catastrophe risk) at R+V is the main type of risk that could be significantly affected by physical climate risk. Spe- cifically, in any one year, the actual impact from the size and frequency of losses could exceed the forecast impact.
237;DZ_Bank_2022_EN;30;0;;;;;;;;;;;In both the Bank sector and the Insurance sector, physical climate risk could also give rise to operational risk, for exam- ple in connection with the non-availability of buildings or IT systems due to weather or environmental events.

In doing so, they are supporting the European action plan for financing sustainable growth and supporting their customers’ sustainability transition.
270;DZ_Bank_2022_EN;35;0;;;;;;;;;;;The DZ BANK Group believes it is important to measure and manage the impact of its business activities in order to make a targeted contribution to sustainability. In 2020, the 17 UN sustainable development goals (SDGs) were specified as the standardized framework for classifying the activities of DZ BANK Group entities. DZ BANK has developed its own methodologies on this basis in the form of SDG classification and technology mapping, and now regularly applies these to various (sub-)portfolios.
271;DZ_Bank_2022_EN;35;0;;;;;;;;;;;Other methods of classifying and evaluating activities with regard to their sustainability impact include carbon accounting and the sustainability risk classifi- cation ( › section 6.3 Risk management ) as well as the taxon- omy developed by the European Union (EU).SDG classification SDG classification analyzes the contribution to the 17 SDGs made by business activities such as lending.
272;DZ_Bank_2022_EN;35;0;;;;;;;;;;;Based on extensive research of relevant literature and deep industry expertise, a system of indicators at sector and subsector level was developed that makes it possible to assign a meaningful sustainability rating (positive, neutral, or adverse impact) to classifiable items. The aim is for the system to cover a broad range of sustainability impacts across the entire ESG spectrum.
273;DZ_Bank_2022_EN;35;0;;;;;;;;;;;The classification basically addresses the question of which customer activities are funded by DZ BANK, or which activities the customer carries out using the liquidity provided. In the case of funding for a specific purpose, such as project finance for a wind farm, only the directly funded activity is classified – in this case the generation of electric- ity from wind power. Where funding is not provided for a specific use, i.e.
274;DZ_Bank_2022_EN;35;0;;;;;;;;;;;the customer may use the liquidity provided in any way it chooses, the customer is assessed as a whole, based on all its activities. In the case of general finance for an electricity producer, this means that the customer is split proportionally – provided that the necessary information is available – in accordance with the power generation mix (e.g. renewables, gas, nuclear) and then classified accord- ingly.
275;DZ_Bank_2022_EN;35;0;;;;;;;;;;;Consequently, an economic activity may have both positive and adverse impacts for different SDGs and may thus also vary in terms of the volume of renewable energies reported ( › section 5.1 Strategy and goals ). This reflects the complex and diverse reality of SDG impacts.7.

277;DZ_Bank_2022_EN;36;0;;;;;;;;;;;Technology mapping Technology mapping builds on SDG classification (including the splitting that this involves) and aims to create transpar - ency about particularly relevant climate impacts. Here, the focus is placed on the technology on which the financed economic activity is based. The underlying assumption is that the technology used to carry out an economic activity materially affects that activity’s climate impact. There are four possible categories: (1) technology of the future (e.g.
278;DZ_Bank_2022_EN;36;0;;;;;;;;;;;wind energy), (2) transition technology (e.g. certain types of gas-fired power station), (3) indispensable technology (e.g. aircraft), and (4) outdated technology (e.g. coal-fired power plants).Working groups refined the methods for SDG classification and technology mapping in consultation with all relevant departments and with sector experts. The results for all sec- tors were presented and fully documented in the form of indicator trees.
279;DZ_Bank_2022_EN;36;0;;;;;;;;;;;The technology mapping approach is applied to the same portfolios as for SDG classification. Classification of DZ BANK’s business activities SDG classification and technology mapping were applied at DZ BANK for the first time in 2020.
280;DZ_Bank_2022_EN;36;0;;;;;;;;;;;They were used to analyze the corporate customer lending business (referred to below as analyzed classification portfolio) from the corporate banking and structured finance relationship management units, which includes working capital finance and project finance and thus represents only a selection of all DZ BANK assets. A particular focus when selecting the portfolio was longevity, as it is a core aspect of sustainability. On this basis, transactions that are usually of a short-term nature (e.
281;DZ_Bank_2022_EN;36;0;;;;;;;;;;;g. money market loans) were excluded, although overdraft facilities were an exception to this rule. Transactions where DZ BANK is not directly involved as the funding partner (e.g. pass-through loans) were also excluded. As at December 31, 2022, the analysis was carried out again in respect of the loan volume of the analyzed classification portfolio of €78.6 billion (December 31, 2021: €69.4 billion).

As at December 31, 2022, around 66 percent (€51.5 billion) of the volume examined within the analyzed classification portfolio generated at least one positive impact (December 31, 2021: around 65 per- cent or €45.1 billion). A further 23 percent or €18.3 billion (December 31, 2021: 24 percent or €16.6 billion) generated at least one adverse impact on the SDGs. Around 26 percent or €20.
286;DZ_Bank_2022_EN;37;0;;;;;;;;;;;1 billion (December 31, 2021: around 25 percent or €17.2 billion) generated neither a positive nor an adverse SDG impact and can thus be classified as neutral. These per - centages (and volumes) do not add up to 100 percent because the way that an economic activity is classified may mean it has both positive and adverse SDG impacts.
287;DZ_Bank_2022_EN;37;0;;;;;;;;;;;Positive impacts result in particular from the strengthening of critical infrastructure¹ (SDG 9), for example through the funding of power companies or wholesalers and retailers (particularly in the food sector). Positive impacts are also shown to be generated by trade finance, which drives eco- nomic growth and thus adds to global prosperity (SDG 8). The financing of renewable energies and of natural gas² generates a positive impact in the fight against climate change (SDG 13).

DZ BANK analyzes the adverse impacts on an ongoing basis and plans to actively support customers with the transforma- tion processes they are undergoing to prevent such impacts.
296;DZ_Bank_2022_EN;38;0;;;;;;;;;;;The figure on the previous page shows the aggregated pos- itive and adverse impacts of the analyzed classification port- folio on the 17 SDGs. The classification under the technology mapping approach found that a volume of around €25.6 billion of DZ BANK’s analyzed classification portfolio is linked to climate-related business activities (December 31, 2021: €22,6 billion). More than half of this volume (over €15.
297;DZ_Bank_2022_EN;38;0;;;;;;;;;;;6 billion) is already attrib- utable to technologies of the future and transition tech- nologies (December 31, 2021: €13.7 billion). Among the technologies of the future, the generation of electricity from renewable energy sources is the dominant driver with a con- tribution of €7.5 billion (December 31, 2021: €6.9 billion).

With regard to coal min- ing, DZ BANK is already pulling out of the coal industry and is focusing on supporting (energy supply) companies in their transformation4. Beyond the climate alignment of the focus sectors, DZ BANK is working on the calculation of the cross-sectoral carbon footprint in accordance with the standard of the Partnership for Carbon Accounting for Financials (PCAF).
302;DZ_Bank_2022_EN;39;0;;;;;;;;;;;The financed emissions of the whole portfolio will be published at a later date. Challenges in the context of sustainability Sustainability is a complex and rapidly changing subject area where standards are still being developed. It is therefore often difficult for companies to collect climate-related data and data is not always available at the necessary level of granularity to enable modeling by data providers. For this reason, DZ BANK partly relies on proxy figures.
303;DZ_Bank_2022_EN;39;0;;;;;;;;;;;DZ BANK publishes its climate targets on the basis of the currently available data and methodology. It is expected that methodological standards will continue to develop and data quality will improve over time, so DZ BANK’s analysis and setting of climate targets will remain an ongoing process and results may be updated.Climate alignment DZ BANK is aware that the finance sector has an important role to play in aligning the economy with the Paris climate targets.
304;DZ_Bank_2022_EN;39;0;;;;;;;;;;;It will therefore bring its portfolio into line with the 1.5 °C target and the ’net-zero future’ principle. To imple- ment these aims, the industry sectors that are particularly relevant for decarbonization, known as focus sectors, were analyzed in 2022 with regard to their climate impact, market opportunities, and ESG risks. DZ BANK then used the find- ings as a basis to set specific climate targets ( › section 5.1 Strategy and goals ).
305;DZ_Bank_2022_EN;39;0;;;;;;;;;;;DZ BANK has used the methodology in the Paris Agreement Capital Transition Assessment (PACTA) to provide a detailed analysis of five focus sectors. The physical emissions intensity of each focus sector – energy, automotive, steel, cement, and aviation – was calculated so that they can be managed in the future via sector-specific decarbonization targets.
306;DZ_Bank_2022_EN;39;0;;;;;;;;;;;The Net Zero Emissions by 2050 pathways of the International Energy Agency (IEA) provide the reference for the physical emissions intensity of the DZ BANK portfolio and thus for its conformity with the 1.5 degree target. Climate alignment focuses on the parts of the value chain that exert the great- est leverage effect in terms of decarbonization.
307;DZ_Bank_2022_EN;39;1;;;;;;;;;;;"The fossil fuel and shipping sectors are currently still being analyzed; targets cannot be published yet due to insufficient Application of the classification to other sub-portfolios In 2021, in addition to the corporate customer lending busi- ness (analyzed classification portfolio), DZ BANK applied the classifications to individual segments of the own-account security investments in the banking book (e.g."
308;DZ_Bank_2022_EN;39;1;;;;;;;;;;;corporate bonds and bank bonds), to individual segments of the secu- ritization portfolio, and to the issuance volume in the cor - porate bond business (debt capital markets, DCM) in which DZ BANK acted as manager, bookrunner, or mandated lead arranger during 2022. This was done to ensure greater transparency and the detailed findings for all four portfolios were published in aggregated form in the 2021 sustainabil- ity report.
309;DZ_Bank_2022_EN;39;1;;;;;;;;;;;For the purpose of transparency, this approach was also applied on December 31, 2022. Together, the four portfolios have a total volume of €231.6 billion (December 31, 2021: €200 billion). 57 percent (December 31, 2021: 66 percent) of the volume generates a positive impact on at least one SDG, 12 percent (December 31, 2021: 14 percent) has an adverse impact on at least one SDG, and 37 percent (December 31, 2021: 27 percent) was assessed as neutral.
310;DZ_Bank_2022_EN;39;1;;;;;;;;;;;To date, goals have only been set for the corporate cus- tomer lending business (analyzed classification portfolio) of DZ BANK ( › section 5.1 Strategy and goals ) which is why no aggregated set of detailed results for all four portfolios has been published this year. 3 The basis for the climate alignment of the focus sectors consists of finance in the banking book (corporate and project finance). All on-balance-sheet transactions of a finance nature are included, e.g.

313;DZ_Bank_2022_EN;40;0;;;;;;;;;;;Energy The energy sector is critical for achieving the global 1.5 degree target. The emissions of the energy sector, particularly power generation, account for around 35 percent5 of global greenhouse gas emissions. To reduce these emissions, industry and consumers must move rapidly to low-carbon and renewable energy sources. Green power generation is also the key to decarbonization of other sectors (such as automotive and steel).
314;DZ_Bank_2022_EN;40;0;;;;;;;;;;;Suppliers face the further challenge of guaranteeing energy security and providing energy sources such as gas as bridging technology. DZ BANK’s portfolio in the power generation sector is very well positioned. The initial analysis placed it well below the IEA’s reference pathway for net zero emissions (NZE), at minus 70 percent. The reason is that the direct financing of renewable energies already accounts for over two-thirds of the DZ BANK portfolio.
315;DZ_Bank_2022_EN;40;0;;;;;;;;;;;DZ BANK aims to proactively expand its funding of renewable energies. It has therefore set itself a decarbonization target of minus 38 percent by 2030.6 5 IEA World Energy Outlook 2022, power generation excluding heat generation 6 The stated decarbonization target for all sectors relates to the baseline year 2022.

319;DZ_Bank_2022_EN;41;0;;;;;;;;;;;Automotive The automotive sector generates around 8 percent of global greenhouse gas emissions7. The focus here is on vehicle manufacturers. New drive technologies will be key to accelerating decarbonization within the sector, partic- ularly hybrid and all-electric vehicles. In the medium and long term, other drive systems such as fuel cells may also be an option, although these currently lag far behind battery-powered electric drives when it comes to market readiness.

323;DZ_Bank_2022_EN;42;0;;;;;;;;;;;Steel There is an enormous need to decarbonize in the steel sector, due to the very high emissions generated in production. The steel industry is responsible for around 8 percent8 of global greenhouse gas emissions. Significant savings in CO2 cannot be achieved through short-term process optimization alone. Structural changes are cost-intensive, but in the long-term will be unavoidable for the sector’s net zero transformation.
324;DZ_Bank_2022_EN;42;0;;;;;;;;;;;The focus is on the switch to electric arc furnaces, which are powered with natural gas or hydrogen rather than coal. DZ BANK is positioning itself here as a reliable partner to its business partners and is supporting them in switching to the lower-emission electric arc furnace production route. DZ BANK is starting from a strong position of 35 percent below the IEA reference pathway.
325;DZ_Bank_2022_EN;42;0;;;;;;;;;;;One reason for this is that many of DZ BANK’s business partners already use lower-emission electric arc furnaces. Against this background, DZ BANK has set itself the target of reducing physical emissions intensity by 18 percent by 2030. 8 IEA World Energy Outlook 2022SECTOR BRIEFING: STEEL VALUE CHAIN The focus within the steel sector is on steel production.

328;DZ_Bank_2022_EN;43;0;;;;;;;;;;;Cement The cement sector is currently responsible for about 7 percent of global greenhouse gas emissions.9 The decarbonization of the cement sector presents a number of major challenges for this market. This is because a large proportion of the emissions are generated by calcination during cement production and are unavoidable. These are what are known as process emis- sions. Research is ongoing into solutions, such as reducing the so-called clinker factor.
329;DZ_Bank_2022_EN;43;0;;;;;;;;;;;CCUS solutions (carbon capture, utilization, and storage) will be extremely important for decarbon- izing the sector. In Germany, the regulatory framework for these technologies as a prerequi- site for decarbonization of the sector is currently in the final stages of preparation. DZ BANK’s starting point in the cement sector is good, and only just above the IEA reference pathway (3 percent).

332;DZ_Bank_2022_EN;44;0;;;;;;;;;;;Aviation Direct emissions from aviation account for around 2 percent of global greenhouse gas emis- sions. The majority is produced in flight operations through the combustion of kerosene jet fuel. In the short term, technical and operational efficiency improvements can lower these emis- sions. These include the use of more efficient fleets, operations scheduling, and air traffic management.
333;DZ_Bank_2022_EN;44;0;;;;;;;;;;;In the medium term, sustainable aviation fuels (SAFs), which are produced without the use of fossil fuels, will be available. Airline companies in the DZ BANK portfo- lio are innovative and are already trialing the use of SAFs. Hydrogen-based approaches are potentially a solution for the long term. DZ BANK has a good position to build on in the aviation sector.
334;DZ_Bank_2022_EN;44;0;;;;;;;;;;;The physical emissions inten- sity of its portfolio in 2022 was 44 percent below the reference pathway of the IEA11, as a large proportion of its business partners already operate efficient fleets. Decarbonization targets must take account of the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic. Airline capacity utilization fell over this period and utilization efficiency also contracted dramatically. Corrected for COVID, DZ BANK is 44 percent below the reference pathway.
335;DZ_Bank_2022_EN;44;0;;;;;;;;;;;On this basis, DZ BANK has set itself the target of reducing physical emissions intensity by 17 percent by 2030. 11 IEA World Energy Outlook 2022 10 Physical emissions intensity 1 kg CO2e/pkm (pkm = Passenger, km = kilometer) multiplied by the number of passengers carried (not number of seats)SECTOR BRIEFING: AVIATION VALUE CHAIN The focus in the aviation sector is on airline operators, as they are responsible for the majority of flights carried out and therefore for the majority of emissions.

339;DZ_Bank_2022_EN;45;0;;;;;;;;;;;of March 9, 2022. It includes disclosure obligations relating to economic activity in the nuclear and gas sectors, which since January 1, 2023, now have to be published. However, at the time this report was prepared, no information was available from customers of the DZ BANK banking group that could be used as the basis for meaningful information as required by the regulatory authority for mandatory disclo- sures on EU-taxonomy eligibility.
340;DZ_Bank_2022_EN;45;0;;;;;;;;;;;The relevant group of consolidated entities for mandatory disclosures is the DZ BANK banking group The EU taxonomy requires DZ BANK to disclose certain infor - mation in its sustainability report. Voluntary disclosures within the mandatory disclosures are not permitted and, so far as they are made, the two categories must be clearly segregated.
341;DZ_Bank_2022_EN;45;0;;;;;;;;;;;In accordance with the delegated acts that have already been published, banks must publish disclosures in the context of the EU taxonomy at the highest level of regulatory consoli- dation. For DZ BANK, this is the DZ BANK banking group, in which the R+V subgroup is accounted for under the equity method rather than as an insurance subsidiary.
342;DZ_Bank_2022_EN;45;0;;;;;;;;;;;No mandatory disclosures for the insurance subsidiary R+V As a result, in accordance with the legislation, the R+V insurance subsidiary is exempt from having to produce a separate report in the context of the EU taxonomy because of the reporting obligations of its parent company DZ BANK. In the interests of transparency, however, this report includes voluntary disclosures from R+V that are relevant to the EU taxonomy in a different section.
343;DZ_Bank_2022_EN;45;0;;;;;;;;;;;Annex XI of Delegated Regulation (EU) 2021/2178 supple- menting article 8 of the EU Taxonomy Regulation. In the development of a target vision for the sustainability classification at the level of DZ BANK AG, the EU Taxonomy Regulation was taken into consideration even before it came into force. The EU taxonomy is one of a total of five relevant sources of requirements that formed the basis of the target vision for the sustainability classification.
344;DZ_Bank_2022_EN;45;0;;;;;;;;;;;The SDG classifica- tion marked the first step in DZ BANK’s ambition to develop and technically implement the target vision. The next stage in expanding the sustainability classification is to develop an approach based on the EU Taxonomy Regulation in order to cover this requirement as well.
345;DZ_Bank_2022_EN;45;0;;;;;;;;;;;In 2021 and 2022, in the context of the EU Taxonomy Regu- lation, the DZ BANK banking group and R+V engaged with the requirements of the taxonomy and the processes for determining the relevant key indicators. December 31, 2023 will be the first time that it is possible to disclose a green asset ratio calculated on the basis of a granular assessment of the individual financed activities.
346;DZ_Bank_2022_EN;45;0;;;;;;;;;;;This is because 2022 is the first financial year for which the corporate customers of the DZ BANK banking group and R+V are required to report the necessary data. It will therefore not be possible until a later date to conduct an internal analysis of the extent to which economic activities that are aligned with the requirements of the EU taxonomy are to be financed by the DZ BANK banking group and R+V in the future, potentially in a targeted manner.
347;DZ_Bank_2022_EN;45;0;;;;;;;;;;;The EU Commission amended the EU taxonomy regulation (EU/2021/2178) with Delegated Regulation (EU) 2022/1214 The goal of the EU action plan for financing sustainable growth, published in March 2018, is to channel capital flows toward activities that are environmentally sustainable. A common understanding of what counts as an environmen- tally sustainable activity is an essential part of this.
348;DZ_Bank_2022_EN;45;1;;;;;;;;;;;Verifiable criteria that enable an activity to be classified as environmen- tally sustainable are also needed. The EU Taxonomy Regu- lation, which came into force on January 1, 2022, sets out to create this framework by defining criteria to determine which economic activities qualify as environmentally sustain- able and by specifying relevant disclosure requirements (in article 8).
349;DZ_Bank_2022_EN;45;1;;;;;;;;;;;Each of the envisaged total of six environmental objectives is set out in more detail pursuant to articles 10 (3), 11 (3), 12 (2), 13 (2), 14 (2), and 15 (2) of the EU Taxonomy Regulation through technical screening criteria, which are dealt with in delegated acts. The scope of this quantitative information is being increased over a period of several years as part of a phase-in process set out by the European Union that begins with the report- ing for the year ended December 31, 2021.
350;DZ_Bank_2022_EN;45;1;;;;;;;;;;;Currently, only the environmental objectives of climate change mitigation and climate change adaptation have had technical screen- ing criteria established for them. A green asset ratio (GAR) calculated on the basis of a granular analysis of individual activities is required for the first time for the year ended December 31, 2023. Other reporting requirements will come into effect in stages after this.
351;DZ_Bank_2022_EN;45;1;;;;;;;;;;;In addition to the quantitative information, disclosures have to be made of the qualitative information referred to in 7.2 Mandatory disclosures for the DZ BANK banking group under the EU taxonomy | | | | | | | |Contents Company profile Strategy Corporate management Business processes Employees Corporate citizenship Annex Business portfolio45 DZ BANK 2022 Sustainability Report 45.
352;DZ_Bank_2022_EN;46;0;;;;;;;;;;;eligible for the EU taxonomy on the basis of the previously published requirements because the application of technical screening criteria found that the financed activities were economic activities covered by the EU Taxonomy Regulation. At the time this report was prepared, not all questions of interpretation in respect of the balance sheet KPIs required by the EU Taxonomy Regulation had been answered.
353;DZ_Bank_2022_EN;46;0;;;;;;;;;;;"In par - ticular, there has been discussion about whether the balance sheet KPIs required by the EU Taxonomy Regulation, includ- ing the proportion of taxonomy-eligible assets, should use all assets for the denominator or, alternatively, only the GAR assets. The first interpretation results in a more conservative picture with lower ratios of taxonomy eligibility; the latter results in higher ratios of taxonomy eligibility."
354;DZ_Bank_2022_EN;46;0;;;;;;;;;;;The DZ BANK banking group decided to disclose both ratios in the report- ing as at December 31, 2022. It is imperative that this is taken into account when making comparisons using these figures. The proportion of taxonomy-eligible assets is only truly meaningful when used in conjunction with the other required KPIs, as these explain in particular which other assets are excluded from the taxonomy eligibility test on the basis of the previously published requirements.
355;DZ_Bank_2022_EN;46;0;;;;;;;;;;;As at December 31, 2022, 67 percent of the GAR assets had to be excluded from the taxonomy eligibility review on the basis of stipulations made by the regulator (December 31, 2021: 60 percent).
356;DZ_Bank_2022_EN;46;0;;;;;;;;;;;Based on the total assets of the DZ BANK banking group, this gives a taxonomy eligibility ratio as at December 31, 2022 of 16 percent when applying the revenue-based cus- tomer ratios of taxonomy eligibility (December 31, 2021: 14 percent) and a taxonomy eligibility ratio also of 16 percent when applying the CapEx-based customer ratios of taxon- omy eligibility (December 31, 2021: 14 percent).
357;DZ_Bank_2022_EN;46;0;;;;;;;;;;;As at December 31, 2022, 76 percent of total assets had to be excluded from the taxonomy eligibility review on the basis of stipulations made by the regulator (December 31, 2021: 71 percent).
358;DZ_Bank_2022_EN;46;0;;;;;;;;;;;Explanatory notes on the EU taxonomy KPIs of the DZ BANK banking group Article 10 of Delegated Regulation (EU) 2021/2178 supple- menting article 8 of the EU Taxonomy Regulation stipulates that quantitative information in the form of specified KPIs shall form the main focus of mandatory reporting for banks for the period ended December 31, 2022. The proportion of taxonomy-eligible assets form the main focus of the reporting.

360;DZ_Bank_2022_EN;46;0;;;;;;;;;;;The balance sheet structure for the KPIs required by the EU Taxonomy Regulation was operationalized in accordance with the structure of the financial reporting requirements (FINREP) implemented in the DZ BANK banking group. The following disclosures are made in this context. The European Commission introduces the term ’GAR assets’ in its requirements for EU taxonomy reporting.
361;DZ_Bank_2022_EN;46;0;;;;;;;;;;;These are assets which, in the future calculation of the green asset ratio, are used for the denominator or for the denominator and the numerator. In contrast, the ’other assets’ are not included in the future calculation of the green asset ratio.

374;DZ_Bank_2022_EN;49;0;;;;;;;;;;;Similarly, the information is presented differently by the cus- tomers and in some cases is not complete. For example, the EU Taxonomy Regulation requires relevant customers to disclose ratios of taxonomy eligibility based on revenue and capital expenditure (CapEx). Where both ratios were specified by the customer, they were used to calculate the relevant results for the DZ BANK banking group.
375;DZ_Bank_2022_EN;49;0;;;;;;;;;;;If, how- ever, only one non-specified value was disclosed by the cus- tomer, this was used to calculate both results. This was the case for finance companies in the reporting as at December 31, 2022. For a very small proportion of assets approved for the assess- ment of EU taxonomy eligibility, the customer data necessary for the review was not available.
376;DZ_Bank_2022_EN;49;0;;;;;;;;;;;Explanatory notes on the review of taxonomy eligibility in the case of funding for a specified purpose For the year ended December 31, 2022, the DZ BANK bank- ing group classified funding that had a specified purpose and was approved for assessment of taxonomy eligibility as taxonomy-eligible where the funding constituted consumer home finance or commercial real estate finance (as it had also done as at December 31, 2021).
377;DZ_Bank_2022_EN;49;0;;;;;;;;;;;The DZ BANK banking group also classified funding as taxon- omy-eligible if, under the EU Taxonomy Regulation, the fund- ing purpose agreed with the customer could be assigned to taxonomy-eligible activities pursuant to Delegated Regulation (EU) 2021/2139.they are part of a group of companies, are treated for the purposes of this EU taxonomy reporting as not subject to a reporting obligation.
378;DZ_Bank_2022_EN;49;0;;;;;;;;;;;The DZ BANK banking group did not treat these customers as being the same as their NFRD-liable parent company, i.e. it did not assign them the EU taxonomy ratios from the parent company. The reasons for this approach lie in the details of the require- ments of the EU Taxonomy Regulation with its reference to EU Regulation 575/2013, according to which reporting should be structured according to direct customers.
379;DZ_Bank_2022_EN;49;0;;;;;;;;;;;At the same time, for the reporting date of December 31, 2022, there is already a requirement to base the structuring of the results data on the results presentation table for GAR that is mandatory from December 31, 2023. In this table, receiv- ables from non-finance companies that are not subject to a separate reporting requirement under NFRD are to be dis- closed in an area where there can be no further information on any EU taxonomy eligibility or conformity.
380;DZ_Bank_2022_EN;49;0;;;;;;;;;;;Explanatory notes on the quantification of taxonomy eligibility using the KPI method Using the KPI method, i.e. the approach of applying the ratios of taxonomy eligibility disclosed by the individual cus- tomers, the DZ BANK banking group classified the relevant proportion of funding that did not have a specified purpose and was approved for assessment of taxonomy eligibility as taxonomy-eligible for the year ended December 31, 2022.

382;DZ_Bank_2022_EN;49;1;;;;;;;;;;;The NFRD requirement was operationalized on the legal basis of the CSR Directive Imple- mentation Act (CSR-RUG), which in 2017 implemented the Non-financial Reporting Directive (NFRD – Directive 2014/95/ EU) in German law. Against this background, screening is carried out on the basis of the following cumulative criteria to determine whether customers of the DZ BANK banking group are sub- ject to an NFRD requirement for the purposes of EU taxono- my-related reporting: 1.

386;DZ_Bank_2022_EN;50;0;;;;;;;;;;;6 Insurance details the extent to which R+V’s sus- tainability strategy for its investments takes account of the objective of the EU Taxonomy Regulation, which is to sup- port the transition to an economy that is safe, carbon-neu- tral, climate-resilient, efficient in its use of resources, and more circular in nature.
387;DZ_Bank_2022_EN;50;0;;;;;;;;;;;The following section provides information on the extent to which R+V’s investing activities are associated with envi- ronmentally sustainable economic activities as defined by article 8 (1) of the EU Taxonomy Regulation (EU 2020/852). The specific taxonomy-related KPIs for its portfolio of invest- ments pursuant to Delegated Regulation (EU) 2021/2178 supplementing article 8 of the EU Taxonomy Regulation are also reported.
388;DZ_Bank_2022_EN;50;0;;;;;;;;;;;Based on the total volume of exposures on the asset side of R+V’s consolidated balance sheet, a waterfall system is used to assign the investments to the following relevant line items in order to meet the requirement of article 10 of Delegated Regulation (EU) 2021/2178.The line item ’Other GAR assets excluded in accordance with the requirement’ was also voluntarily added to the table of results in order to explain all the components that make up the total GAR assets.
389;DZ_Bank_2022_EN;50;0;;;;;;;;;;;As in the prior year, this item contains ‘cash and cash-related assets’ and ‘other assets (e.g. good- will, commodities)’.As at the reporting date on December 31, 2022, the item also includes other receivables from local public authorities. As at the reporting date on December 31, 2021, these assets were still included in the line item ’approved for taxonomy eligibility assessment in accordance with requirement’.
390;DZ_Bank_2022_EN;50;0;;;;;;;;;;;The sub-total line item ’Other assets’ was voluntarily added to the table of results in order to report the proportion of total assets that do not fall under GAR assets, in accordance with the requirement. The balance sheet line item ‘exposure to central, regional and local governments, central banks, and supranational organizations’ also includes ‘cash held at central banks’. As is the case with FINREP , public-sector finance is not part of this item.

393;DZ_Bank_2022_EN;50;0;;;;;;;;;;;"As in 2021, the balance sheet line item ’Derivatives’ contains derivatives held for trading purposes in addition to the deriv- atives held for hedging purposes. For the purposes of EU taxonomy reporting, these were removed from the held-for- trading assets.

406;DZ_Bank_2022_EN;52;0;;;;;;;;;;;Data sources and restrictions For the calculation of the KPIs, the relevant data for real estate, special real estate funds, and loans secured against real estate is taken from R+V’s master data sets. Data that was included from consolidated subsidiaries and special- ized service providers in the DZ BANK Group was obtained directly from the counterparties. For liquid asset classes such as equities and bonds, specific data packages are obtained from the ESG data provider ISS ESG.
407;DZ_Bank_2022_EN;52;0;;;;;;;;;;;These are also used to determine whether there is a reporting requirement under the NFRD. For relevant counterparties without available pro- vider data, the data was collected independently. Available information from the fund providers for externally managed funds and direct investee companies is also included in the data collection. Non-life insurance With premiums of €6,735.6 million (including casualty insur - ance) in 2022, the R+V Group is one of the biggest non-life insurers in Germany.
408;DZ_Bank_2022_EN;52;0;;;;;;;;;;;The overall taxonomy-eligible premium volume comes to €4,466.5 million. To determine whether the premiums written are taxonomy-el- igible, they are first matched with the lines of business (LoBs) and then assessed for their relevance to the climate. If the respective premiums have no climate relevance, they are not evaluated.

410;DZ_Bank_2022_EN;52;0;;;;;;;;;;;Now, in the second period of reporting, the taxonomy-eligible exposures include investments in real estate, consolidated subsidiar - ies, data from the specialized service providers within the DZ BANK Group and – where available – exposures to issuers subject to NFRD reporting and taxonomy-eligible fund units. The following section goes into greater detail on the under - lying assumptions regarding classification of the businesses involving real estate and loans secured against real estate.
411;DZ_Bank_2022_EN;52;0;;;;;;;;;;;Economic activities linked to direct or fund-based invest- ment in real estate and to real estate finance (loans secured against real estate, commercial real estate finance) can be classified as taxonomy-eligible in accordance with Delegated Regulation (EU) 2021/2139, annex I (7). The requirement to disclose KPIs for the financing portfolio encompasses residential property or building renovation loans.
412;DZ_Bank_2022_EN;52;0;;;;;;;;;;;In R+V’s holdings, retail loans secured against real estate are classified as taxonomy-eligible. For commercial real estate loans, an assessment is carried out of the coun- terparty’s reporting requirement under the NFRD. The increase in the ratio of taxonomy-eligible exposures, from 12.37 percent in 2021 to 18.95 percent in 2022, is largely due to the improved data coverage for companies and funds.
413;DZ_Bank_2022_EN;52;1;;;;;;;;;;;Funds that are ‘non-look-through’ due to lack of available data on the part of the fund providers (e.g. mutual funds and alternative investment funds) are excluded from the tax- onomy eligibility assessment as at the reporting date. Differences in valuation compared with the financial declaration There is a non-material difference between the balance sheet prepared under the taxonomy and the IFRS consoli- dated balance sheet.
414;DZ_Bank_2022_EN;52;1;;;;;;;;;;;This difference in valuation is attribut- able to the differences in price between the fund holdings for which the ‘look-through’ approach is used and the investment management company valuations used for the consolidated financial statements. Assessment of taxonomy eligibility Finally, taxonomy-eligible and taxonomy-non-eligible expo- sures and their share of the overall portfolio are identified and classified.
415;DZ_Bank_2022_EN;52;1;;;;;;;;;;;In accordance with the EU taxonomy, eco- nomic activities are deemed to be taxonomy-eligible if they can contribute to climate change mitigation or climate change adaptation during the reporting period. The EU tax- onomy classifies these activities on the basis of the industrial sectors defined under NACE (annexes I and II of the dele- gated climate regulation (EU) 2021/2139).

432;DZ_Bank_2022_EN;55;0;;;;;;;;;;;The aim of this procedure is to prohibit transactions that do not meet the minimum criteria in rela- tion to environmental, social, and corporate governance (ESG) aspects or that are associated with an increased risk of reputational damage to the DZ BANK Group. Among the excluded industries are arms trading, arms pro- duction, the sex industry, and controversial gambling.

439;DZ_Bank_2022_EN;55;0;;;;;;;;;;;In 2022, these criteria were extended to include parts of the portfolio that are managed by external asset managers. It is planned that R+V will continue gradually adding to its rejec- tion criteria in 2023 in line with the requirements of the ESG target market concept of the BVR and other associations.

It is the result of the proprietary EESG (economic, environment, social, corporate governance) analysis model that is applied across the entire research universe of DZ BANK.
476;DZ_Bank_2022_EN;59;0;;;;;;;;;;;The information obtained is primarily aimed at cooperative banks and institutional investors in Germany and abroad that want to examine the sustainability credentials of their investments. An analytical approach for assessing the ESG credentials of countries, companies, and banks forms the core of DZ BANK’s sustainability research.
477;DZ_Bank_2022_EN;59;0;;;;;;;;;;;The EESG analysis model that is used for this approach combines the three traditional ESG (environment, social, corporate governance) dimensions with an economic dimension (economic) and classifies the analyzed issuers as either ‘sustainable’ or ‘not sustainable’.
478;DZ_Bank_2022_EN;59;0;;;;;;;;;;;The analysis takes account of two dynamic sustainability limits – the average EESG score in the respective sector/ industry and the average EESG score in the overall invest-ment universe – as well as firm and soft rejection criteria and any recent major controversies. Hard rejection criteria such as violations of fundamental human rights automatically result in a classification as ‘not sustainable’.
479;DZ_Bank_2022_EN;59;0;;;;;;;;;;;In the case of soft rejection criteria, the classification as ‘not sustainable’ is dependent on a predefined threshold being exceeded – e.g. if a food company generates more than a specific proportion of its revenue from business with alcoholic beverages. Com- panies that have been classified as sustainable are awarded the DZ BANK seal of approval for sustainability and are iden- tified as sustainable issuers in research publications.
480;DZ_Bank_2022_EN;59;0;;;;;;;;;;;Alongside the investment universe of DZ BANK equity and credit research, which includes almost 600 issuers, the sus- tainability research database comprised more than 5,000 issuers in 2022.

The sustainability approach for DZ BANK’s securities portfolio is mainly based on the application of the rules and require- ments that are also applied in the traditional lending busi- ness. For the sustainability-related credit check, DZ BANK uses a sustainability checklist that is based on the ten princi- ples of the UN Global Compact.
510;DZ_Bank_2022_EN;62;0;;;;;;;;;;;For loan facilities that serve as a basis for an investment decision in the securities port- folio, the checklist takes account of both industry-specific sectoral rules and rejection criteria ( › section 7.3 Rejection criteria and sectoral rules ).

Sustainability-linked syndicated loans DZ BANK arranges and participates in syndicated loans. The proportion of syndicated loans that are set up as sustainabil- ity-linked loans has increased recently, especially in the tradi- tional corporate lending business.
538;DZ_Bank_2022_EN;64;0;;;;;;;;;;;For this form of funding, sustainability principles and company-specific KPIs are devel- oped collaboratively by the arranger(s) and the customer. This requires the customer to disclose the relevant sustain- ability data either because it is subject to the EU taxonomy legislation or because it voluntarily publishes a sustainability report.
539;DZ_Bank_2022_EN;64;0;;;;;;;;;;;The lending conditions are adjusted over the full term of the loan in accordance with the borrower’s sustainability performance as measured by the agreed KPIs. Depending on the performance that has been achieved, the interest margin is usually adjusted once per year as an incentivization mech- anism.to assess the potential for medium-term deterioration in the rating of the borrower based on risks associated with ESG factors.
540;DZ_Bank_2022_EN;64;0;;;;;;;;;;;In addition, where relevant, risks associated with ESG factors that could affect the value of collateral are ana- lyzed and documented in the first valuation and any subse- quent valuation of collateral. Joint credit and syndicated loan business headed by other banks is excluded from this. So far, DZ BANK has only rejected loans on the basis of the rejection criteria and not in view of sustainability aspects ( › section 7.3 Rejection criteria and sectoral rules ).
541;DZ_Bank_2022_EN;64;1;;;;;;;;;;;Since July 2022, risks associated with ESG factors have also had to be included in regular and ad hoc credit control, where relevant.

The engagements in the field of renewable energies also form the basis for the green bonds issued by DZ BANK (› section 7.4.2 Capital market ). The number of new onshore wind turbines erected in Ger - many increased moderately in 2022. But the approval proce- dures for wind farms are still slow. Planning objections and legal actions, coupled with the effects of the war in Ukraine, led to considerable project delays.
545;DZ_Bank_2022_EN;65;0;;;;;;;;;;;In 2022, DZ BANK supported the first renewable energy projects outside the scope of the grants under the German Renewable Energy Sources Act (EEG). Instead, it supported them through power purchase agreements (PPAs). These are long-term bilateral electricity supply contracts, generally between an electricity producer and an electricity customer. This funding format has been used at international level for a long time.
546;DZ_Bank_2022_EN;65;0;;;;;;;;;;;The supported projects involve funding for photovoltaics with bespoke and complex structures.Infrastructure finance Alongside its activities in the renewable energies sector, DZ BANK also provides project finance for infrastructure projects. The use of private capital and expertise to deliver public infrastructure projects has become a growth market.

Export finance As part of its export finance activities, DZ BANK supports major German, European, and US exporters with their inter - national business by offering buyer’s credit to international borrowers.
548;DZ_Bank_2022_EN;65;0;;;;;;;;;;;Export finance projects benefit from export credit guarantees that the relevant national export credit agency in the exporter’s country (such as Euler Hermes in Germany) grants to the bank.
549;DZ_Bank_2022_EN;65;1;;;;;;;;;;;For the export credit agencies, and especially for Euler Hermes, the checking of environmental, social, and human rights aspects is a key criterion when assessing the merit of an application for an export credit guarantee based on the mandatory procedures and assess- ment criteria of the Common Approaches of the Organisa- tion for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD).
550;DZ_Bank_2022_EN;65;1;;;;;;;;;;;At DZ BANK, all activities in the field of renewable energies are carefully evaluated on the basis of commercial and legal criteria. The result is a project-specific risk rating and risk allocation. In addition, the bank’s internal requirements for sustainability in the lending business, including the Equator Principles, are applied. Loan commitments in the area of renewable energies stood at €6.48 billion (including issuer and replacement risks) as at December 31, 2022, compared with €5.
551;DZ_Bank_2022_EN;65;1;;;;;;;;;;;97 billion at the end of 2021. The bulk of these commitments are linked to wind energy, particularly the construction of onshore wind farms. The renewable energies portfolio is set to grow to €7.1 bil- lion by 2026. Most of the funding is delivered in the form of project finance. In this context, both traditional bank loans funded from the bank’s own liquidity and pass-through development loans play a significant role.

588;DZ_Bank_2022_EN;69;0;;;;;;;;;;;– Strategy: Physical climate risks and transition risks are systematically examined in an annual review of the seg- ment and business area strategy. The findings are pack- aged together by the central sustainability management team and incorporated into the review of the strategic sustainability target. – Risk management: Climate risks have been compre- hensively factored into a wide range of risk management processes at company level and core business level.
589;DZ_Bank_2022_EN;69;0;;;;;;;;;;;Sustainability risks are viewed as drivers of the classic financial and non-financial risk types. They are therefore integrated into existing risk control systems. – KPIs: At company level, the KPIs are linked to environ- mental management data, primarily data relating to the attainment of climate strategy targets. In portfolio man- agement, for example, the KPI is the level of carbon emis- sions funded.

In response to climate change and to cope with the growing number of EU regulatory reporting requirements, R+V introduced a new strategy that clearly sets out its ambitions in the area of sustainability.
610;DZ_Bank_2022_EN;71;0;;;;;;;;;;;Investments now have to meet minimum standards with regard to environmental, social, and corporate governance aspects (ESG aspects). The new strategy also confirms R+V’s self-imposed target of carbon neutrality for its investment portfolio by 2050, with ambitious interim targets. The investing activity should thus be actively used to ensure that investments are designed sustainably.

It provides the basis for the internal sustainability check and informs the portfolio man- agers whether a new investment is right for R+V from a sustainability perspective.
615;DZ_Bank_2022_EN;71;1;;;;;;;;;;;For publicly traded securities, the ESG integration approach examines ESG controversies, ESG ratings, and a climate score, based on data from external providers. The assessment of ESG controversies involves examining whether there are any controversial sustainability issues associated with the investment. The ESG ratings compare individual securities based on a number of ESG KPIs to produce R+V’s own sustainability score.
616;DZ_Bank_2022_EN;71;1;;;;;;;;;;;The climate score quantifies physical and, above all, transition risks through illustrative calculations based on various climate scenarios. It thus provides a gauge for the risks to the issuer of the secu- rity caused by climate change. Companies with controversial business practices or the lowest scores are examined by the ESG task force, R+V’s internal ESG risk controlling body.

622;DZ_Bank_2022_EN;72;0;;;;;;;;;;;As there is not yet enough data and uniform measurement methods are not yet available for all invest- ments, R+V aims to gradually integrate further relevant asset classes into the climate target over the next few years. To achieve the goal of net zero by 2050, R+V will have to set binding interim targets at regular intervals.
623;DZ_Bank_2022_EN;72;0;;;;;;;;;;;The first interim target is for the carbon footprint (scope 1 and 2 emissions and enterprise value including cash (EVIC)) for the equities of large European companies and corporate bonds in the non-financial sector to be reduced by 20 percent by 2025, compared with 2019 levels. These two asset classes account for a substantial proportion of the known CO2 emissions in investment activities.
624;DZ_Bank_2022_EN;72;0;;;;;;;;;;;To achieve its climate target and for the ongoing monitoring and implementation of the relevant requirements necessary for this, R+V established a carbon task force process in its ESG risk controlling department in 2022. Products for sustainability Since August 2, 2022, there has been a requirement during the advisory process to ask policyholders whether, and to what extent, they wish to incorporate sustainability aspects into the planned investment.
625;DZ_Bank_2022_EN;72;0;;;;;;;;;;;"The preferences that they express determine whether a product can be recommended without qualification or not.company, underweighting, a halt on new investments, or even divestment. R+V works with ESG data providers ISS ESG and MSCI to carry out the sustainability analysis; these partners provide R+V with a broad range of sustainability data."
626;DZ_Bank_2022_EN;72;0;;;;;;;;;;;An internal ESG assessment process coupled with the incorporation of ESG aspects into due diligence processes and strict monitor - ing ensures that the targets and requirements are met. Climate neutrality (net zero) by 2050 Reducing CO2 emissions is a binding target for R+V invest- ment.
627;DZ_Bank_2022_EN;72;0;;;;;;;;;;;R+V therefore set itself a science-based climate target in 2021 for its investment activity, which includes cutting greenhouse gas emissions (measured in CO2 equivalents) from investment activities to (net) zero by 2050. R+V is guided by the agreement to limit average global tempera- ture rises to a maximum of 1.5 °C above pre-industrial levels. The climate target also allows R+V to promote its product lines as eco-friendly.

Under a partnership with Mer, R+V offers free advice to customers with a fleet of 50 or more vehicles and approximately 200 employees to help them switch to electric vehicles. Products with a positive social impact include employee insurance and health insurance policies: As costs are covered both for an insured event and for medical check-ups, the protection against financial risks is always in line with the principle of improving general healthcare.

The severe rainfall event suffered by the Ahr Valley in the summer of 2021 vividly illustrated the need for such protection and sparked growing demand for this type of insurance. R+V has also been playing its part in the shift toward cleaner transportation for some time.
631;DZ_Bank_2022_EN;73;0;;;;;;;;;;;Since 2018, for example, own- ers of electric and hybrid vehicles have been able to obtain significantly extended insurance cover. One of the enduring key features of accident and breakdown cover is that an electric car can be towed to the nearest charging point if it breaks down due to an empty battery.
632;DZ_Bank_2022_EN;73;0;;;;;;;;;;;The benefits in R+V’s comprehensive motor insurance also include premium-free insurance for mobile charging devices (up to €1,000) and for charging cables and cards (up to €100) if, for example, they With a portfolio of 119,653 insured photovoltaic systems, 1,304 wind turbines, and 979 biogas installations (as at December 31, 2022), R+V is Germany’s third-biggest pro- vider of engineering insurance and is contributing to the success of the country’s switch to renewable energy sources.
633;DZ_Bank_2022_EN;73;0;;;;;;;;;;;In order to be able to provide tailored solutions, R+V has created a center of excellence for renewable energies and operates a broad network of corporate customer advisors. Customers can also turn to the local cooperative banks for support on insurance matters. Farmers and energy cooper - atives are often the ones to implement wind power, solar power, or biogas projects with funding from their principal cooperative bank.

636;DZ_Bank_2022_EN;75;0;;;;;;;;;;;Satisfied customers are key to establishing and maintaining long-term business relationships and thus to the future via- bility of the DZ BANK Group. Focusing on the needs of cus- tomers is therefore the responsibility of all employees.
637;DZ_Bank_2022_EN;75;0;;;;;;;;;;;In the group entities, collating relevant KPIs, initiating improvement processes, and setting out the specific requirements are tasks assigned to the marketing, product management, and sales functions or, in some cases, to other departments or an interdisciplinary centralized function.
638;DZ_Bank_2022_EN;75;0;;;;;;;;;;;In addition to talking to customers individually, almost all entities in the DZ BANK Group regularly survey their custom- ers to identify their needs, gauge how satisfied they are with products and services, and find out whether improvements are required. The quality and complaints management sys- tems in place, together with a responsible approach to prod- ucts and marketing, help customers to establish trust in the quality of the products and services being offered to them.
639;DZ_Bank_2022_EN;75;0;;;;;;;;;;;In the lending business, the DZ BANK Group’s customer focus is additionally reflected in the various safeguards to prevent customers from overextending themselves. 8.1.1 Customer satisfaction surveys DZ BANK surveys the cooperative banks on their customer satisfaction every three years by asking the Boards of Man- aging Directors of the cooperative banks to complete an online questionnaire that gauges their level of satisfaction with the products and services of DZ BANK.
640;DZ_Bank_2022_EN;75;0;;;;;;;;;;;The aim is to determine where collaboration across all business segments can be optimized and to produce recommendations for action to improve customer satisfaction. In addition, a cus- tomer satisfaction index is calculated. The data collected as part of the 2021 survey resulted in an index value of 60 points on a scale from 0 to 100 (2018: 59 points). The next customer satisfaction survey is planned for spring 2024.
641;DZ_Bank_2022_EN;75;0;;;;;;;;;;;Union Investment also routinely surveys its cooperative part- ner banks on their satisfaction. The results are summarized in a key indicator that forms part of the balanced scorecard, Union Investment’s performance management system. The survey carried out in 2022 produced a satisfaction rat- ing of 2.3 on a scale of 1 (top score) to 5 (lowest score), unchanged from the prior year.
642;DZ_Bank_2022_EN;75;0;;;;;;;;;;;VR Smart Finanz carries out annual surveys of the Boards of Managing Directors of the cooperative banks as well as the heads of their corporate/ business customer units and the heads of sales manage- ment. These surveys are supported by a market research institution and are used to calculate an overall satisfaction index. The results are analyzed during workshops involving relevant departments and the findings are used to develop measures to improve customer satisfaction.
643;DZ_Bank_2022_EN;75;1;;;;;;;;;;;Bausparkasse Schwäbisch Hall uses various tools to gauge how satisfied its customers are with its products, processes, and services. Among these are a quarterly measurement of customer satisfaction based on around 2,000 interviews a year and process-driven customer experience surveys at ten different touchpoints, which generated more than 20,000 feedback submissions in 2022.
644;DZ_Bank_2022_EN;75;1;;;;;;;;;;;The customer feedback is used to calculate the Net Promoter Score (NPS), which determines part of the performance-based remuneration for employees of Bausparkasse Schwäbisch Hall. The NPS for 2022 was 29 points (four points higher than in 2021). The feedback and results are made available to the departments so they can help to find further optimization potential. TeamBank conducts an annual survey among its coopera- tive bank partners.
645;DZ_Bank_2022_EN;75;1;;;;;;;;;;;In 2022, it reached out online to around 1,800 members of the Boards of Managing Directors, heads of consumer finance, and customer advisors in Germany and Austria. The survey results are discussed with the Board of Managing Directors and serve as a basis for the develop- ment of appropriate steps aimed at further improving cus- tomer satisfaction. In addition, TeamBank carries out surveys every other year among merchants offering the Ratenkauf installment purchase product.
646;DZ_Bank_2022_EN;75;1;;;;;;;;;;;In 2022 it contacted 150 of the 1,000 or so merchants in Germany by telephone. Based on the findings, suggestions for improving the product were examined and the available technical options for shortening the payout period for the merchants are now being reac- tivated and communicated. TeamBank measures the satis- faction of its end customers using the Net Promoter Score, which gauges the willingness of customers to recommend the bank to others.
647;DZ_Bank_2022_EN;75;1;;;;;;;;;;;Data for the NPS is collected over the course of the year and comprises feedback from around 9,000 customers from Germany and Austria per year. The findings are used in information documents for the partner banks and for product development.8.1 Customer focus | | | | | | | |Contents Company profile Strategy Corporate management Business portfolio Employees Corporate citizenship Annex Business processes75 DZ BANK 2022 Sustainability Report 75.

All divisions with direct or indirect contact with customers have a complaints manager who ensures that complaints are dealt with in a customer-focused manner, documents the customer complaints, and provides regular reports to the relevant head of division, Internal Audit, Compliance, Risk Controlling, and a central coordina- tion function.
649;DZ_Bank_2022_EN;76;0;;;;;;;;;;;This central function coordinates the overall complaints management system together with the Compli- ance division and works to ensure that processes for dealing appropriately with complaints are in place in all parts of the business. The Compliance division takes particular care to ensure that the way in which complaints are handled meets the regulatory requirements.
650;DZ_Bank_2022_EN;76;0;;;;;;;;;;;DZ BANK’s senior management bears overall responsibility for implementation and for mon- itoring adherence to the relevant guidelines and processes and it receives regular reports on complaints management. For the majority of complaints received by DZ BANK, funda- mental changes to processes or organizational measures are rarely required. The highly individual nature of the reasons for complaints underscores that there are few systematic problems in the business.
651;DZ_Bank_2022_EN;76;0;;;;;;;;;;;Nevertheless, the departments do examine the issues raised in the complaints in order to make continual improvements in the interests of sharehold- ers and customers. As in the last two years, the number of complaints received by DZ BANK in 2022 was in the low hundreds.when processing customer inquiries, especially with regard to customer satisfaction, staff availability, and processing times.
652;DZ_Bank_2022_EN;76;0;;;;;;;;;;;These criteria form part of the target agreements of employees working in the customer dialogue center. R+V has committed to applying the Code of Conduct for the Distribution of Insurance Products issued by the Gesamtver - band der Deutschen Versicherungswirtschaft (GDV) [German Insurance Association]. This code of conduct puts the inter - ests of customers at the center in order to further improve the quality of the advice and products offered.
653;DZ_Bank_2022_EN;76;0;;;;;;;;;;;It comprises eleven principles that provide a framework for fair and needs-based brokerage of insurance products. Independent reviewers check regularly whether the internal sales policies of the company comply with the code of conduct. R+V has adopted internal rules, procedures, and policies that imple- ment the requirements of the code of conduct.
654;DZ_Bank_2022_EN;76;0;;;;;;;;;;;Complaints management When it comes to product quality and delivering on the value proposition sold to customers, complaints can act as an important indicator if they are recorded, analyzed, and assessed systematically. All entities in the DZ BANK Group have therefore established procedures for handling com- plaints. DZ BANK, for example, uses the insights gained in this way to remedy any weaknesses and improve the products and services on offer. Complaints management is organized on a 8.1.
655;DZ_Bank_2022_EN;76;1;;;;;;;;;;;2 Quality management and complaints handling The entities in the DZ BANK Group use a variety of concepts to ensure service quality and to record and process customer complaints. How these concepts are designed in detail depends on the specific business models and activities of the individual entities and their target groups, which differ considerably in some cases. The DZ BANK Group has not issued any centralized guidance on quality assurance and complaints management.
656;DZ_Bank_2022_EN;76;1;;;;;;;;;;;However, all but one of the group entities have established quality management procedures. Quality management The fundamental quality standards for business in financial instruments are set out in the product policy of DZ BANK. This policy applies to all product and customer divisions that are responsible for issuing and selling financial instruments. It is supplemented with more detailed, division-specific rules such as the product guidelines of the Capital Markets Retail Clients division.
657;DZ_Bank_2022_EN;76;1;;;;;;;;;;;DZ BANK ensures that the investment products it develops for retail customers have an adequate risk/return profile and that their complexity is appropriate to the target group. Placements of products for the advisory business of the cooperative banks are systematically aligned with the analy- ses of DZ BANK’s research.

In retail customer business, the intermediary banks carry out credit checks in accordance with the requirements specified by DZ HYP in order to avoid undue hardship and over-indebtedness.
660;DZ_Bank_2022_EN;77;0;;;;;;;;;;;Furthermore, the borrower can be granted an option at the time of signing the agreement that allows repayments to be adjusted three times over the course of the fixed-interest period as a means of adapting to temporary liquidity squeezes. In restructuring and workout cases too, DZ HYP is committed to treating borrowers fairly and implementing any compulsory measures with due care. This is ensured by issuing appropriate proce- dural instructions to employees.
661;DZ_Bank_2022_EN;77;0;;;;;;;;;;;At R+V, the premium collections department and R+V sub- sidiary Unternehmens-Managementberatungs GmbH – a service provider for receivables management – have together defined processes for dealing with customers who are facing payment difficulties. The focus is on finding solutions collab- oratively so that outstanding receivables can be paid and the insurance policies can thus continue. 8.1.
662;DZ_Bank_2022_EN;77;0;;;;;;;;;;;4 Marketing and communications The entities of the DZ BANK Group are committed to upholding the principles of integrity, clarity, and transpar - ency in the messages conveyed by their marketing activities and customer communications. The DZ BANK Group’s code of conduct provides the overarching framework and reflects the shared cooperative values.
663;DZ_Bank_2022_EN;77;0;;;;;;;;;;;All group entities ensure that all customers receive a summary of the household budget calculation (‘financial compass’) on which the decision about their loan application was based, along with advisory doc- umentation including explanatory notes on the product. TeamBank also refers customers to a detailed description of the add-ons available for tailoring their easyCredit loan or (in Austria) their ‘der faire Credit’ loan to their individual circumstances.

Through its ‘VR Smart flexibel’ business loan, VR Smart Finanz offers a flexible ‘blank check’ credit line of up to €100,000 that offers various options, including putting repayments on hold, should the customer’s financial circum- stances change. Customers can also add on a repayment insurance policy to protect against personal risks such as incapacity, divorce, or death.
665;DZ_Bank_2022_EN;77;0;;;;;;;;;;;This is arranged through R+V, a partner in the cooperative financial network. The customer’s creditworthiness, including their ability to service the envis- aged future debt, is checked automatically as part of the application process. DZ HYP also does everything it can to prevent its custom- ers from taking on excessive debt.
666;DZ_Bank_2022_EN;77;0;;;;;;;;;;;In the commercial real estate finance business, it focuses on the mortgageable value of the properties to be financed or secured, and care- fully examines aspects such as the customer’s overall assets and liabilities and their cash flow situation.

The complaints management function bears responsibility for complying with guidelines, avoiding con- flicts of interest when handling complaints, and reporting to BaFin. 8.1.
668;DZ_Bank_2022_EN;77;1;;;;;;;;;;;3 Protection against over-indebtedness The entities of the DZ BANK Group are interested in build- ing long-term relationships with their customers based on a spirit of partnership. Almost every entity in the group has therefore taken steps with the aim of helping to prevent customers from overextending themselves. This includes conducting credit checks and offering loans with flexible terms as well as using transparent communication and plain language.
669;DZ_Bank_2022_EN;77;1;;;;;;;;;;;TeamBank has adopted the Code for Responsible Lend- ing for Consumers issued by the Bankenfachverband e. V. (BFACH) [German Association of Credit Banks]. The bank also provides information on its website, during advisory meetings or calls, upon conclusion of a sale, and in the loan agreement itself to ensure that customers are aware of the flexible terms of their loan should they have any difficulty making repayments.
670;DZ_Bank_2022_EN;77;1;;;;;;;;;;;For example, customers may arrange an extension of the term of the loan in order to reduce or defer the repayments. Important aspects of responsible lending that relate to preventing customers from taking on excessive debt have been included in the lending policy.

Products are designed in such a way that the contributions and premiums to be paid by customers can be dealt with flexibly subject to specific conditions. Cost and fee information is provided along with the contract docu- ments. Details are available online .
675;DZ_Bank_2022_EN;78;0;;;;;;;;;;;In line with the principle of the cooperative advisory process, DZ BANK always strives for accuracy, general clarity, respect, and sustainability in the form and message of its market- ing. It markets its products and services in accordance with the following principles, which were incorporated into the DZ BANK code of conduct in 2022: –We avoid misleading, incorrect, and discriminatory state- ments in our advertising and communications.
676;DZ_Bank_2022_EN;78;0;;;;;;;;;;;–We use a clear design and imagery that are understand- able and free of any content-related or formal discrimina- tion. –The design principles are developed for longevity in order to minimize the production of new marketing materials. Product prospectuses in segments that are subject to legal requirements – for example, in the securities business – are reviewed by the legal department prior to publication.
677;DZ_Bank_2022_EN;78;0;;;;;;;;;;;Com- pliance with the provisions of the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) and other legal requirements regarding data protection, usage rights, and copyrights is ensured in the preparation of these prospectuses.
678;DZ_Bank_2022_EN;78;0;;;;;;;;;;;Because DZ BANK delivers many of its services indirectly through the cooperative banks, it endeavors to regularly train and update their employees so that they are familiar with the features and risks of the financial products and can promote and communicate them to their customers in a responsible manner. To this end, DZ BANK provides them any information communicated to customers is accurate, clear, and easy to follow.
679;DZ_Bank_2022_EN;78;0;;;;;;;;;;;Some of them deliberately avoid the use of small print in their communications. Another important element of responsible marketing is transparency with regard to the risks and costs associated with products. The majority of the group entities have committed to this. DZ BANK plans to implement a multi-stage process to make its websites more user-focused. Optimizing key aspects of accessibility will be a priority.
680;DZ_Bank_2022_EN;78;1;;;;;;;;;;;This includes, for example,, making the sites easier to navigate, ensuring the consistent use of alternative text, and a more contrast-rich design. The multi-bank VR NetWorld software offered by the cooper - ative banks also features a variety of support functions for blind and visually impaired users. These range from the use of symbols rather than colors to special security features for sight-impaired users and a dedicated navigation menu.

701;DZ_Bank_2022_EN;81;0;;;;;;;;;;;The course covers topics such as safe practices for email and internet use, educates employees about common cyber risks (protection against malware, etc.), and recommends what action can be taken to appropriately manage these risks. In addition, information is shared on the intranet on an ad hoc basis to make employees aware of new phishing methods or other cyber risks.
702;DZ_Bank_2022_EN;81;0;;;;;;;;;;;In addition, all group entities are required to appoint a Chief Information Security Officer (CISO) who is responsible for creating the framework for the definition of roles and responsibilities, procedures, processes, and requirements in relation to information security. The Information Security working group, which comprises the CISOs of all group entities, is the central steering committee for information security matters in the DZ BANK Group.

However, there was no loss of cus- tomer data and no fines were imposed. There were no sub- stantiated complaints about data protection breaches. Information security The aim of information security is to safeguard the confiden- tiality, integrity, authenticity, and availability of the data and information used in business processes.
708;DZ_Bank_2022_EN;81;1;;;;;;;;;;;Suitable measures must be taken to adequately protect this data and informa- tion against unauthorized access, disclosure, or modification and against loss or theft. To manage information security, the DZ BANK Group has established a groupwide information security management system (Group ISMS) based on ISO/IEC 27001:2013. Every entity in the group must incorporate the minimum require- ments defined therein into the design of their own informa- tion security management systems.

At the start of 2022, DZ BANK formed a work- ing group of representatives from different departments, who were tasked with identifying areas in which action is required in response to LkSG and developing a plan of action. In July 2022, these activities were transferred to a subproject under the sustainability program. DZ BANK will conduct risk analyses for suppliers and its own business operations over the course of 2023 and will publish its first report in accordance with LkSG in 2024.

726;DZ_Bank_2022_EN;84;0;;;;;;;;;;;Most of the suppliers (primarily service providers, consul- tants, developers, and agencies) are based in Germany. Based on the focus and the product group structure of DZ BANK, it is reasonable to assume that no goods and ser - vices are purchased from providers that are associated with practices or goods that are controversial from an ethical or social perspective.
727;DZ_Bank_2022_EN;84;0;;;;;;;;;;;In 2022, Union Investment’s purchasing and contract man- agement function successfully underwent an on-site audit to obtain BME certification as a sustainable procurement organization.This includes a multi-stage escalation process that can ulti- mately result in a supplier being excluded. Applying this standard, the majority of the group entities – including DZ BANK – classify their suppliers according to their sustainability risks.
728;DZ_Bank_2022_EN;84;0;;;;;;;;;;;Suppliers that are considered to be partic- ularly relevant to sustainability because of their specific activ- ity, the volume of orders placed with them, or country-spe- cific risks are asked more searching questions about sus- tainability aspects. The entities of the DZ BANK Group take reasonable steps to verify whether and to what extent sup- pliers are meeting the sustainability obligations that are stip- ulated in their contracts.
729;DZ_Bank_2022_EN;84;0;;;;;;;;;;;DZ BANK, Bausparkasse Schwäbisch Hall, Union Investment, and VR Smart Finanz hold annual development meetings with suppliers and service providers that are relevant in the context of sustainability.

One of its objectives is to standardize the entities’ environ- mental data and the resulting carbon footprint.
739;DZ_Bank_2022_EN;85;0;;;;;;;;;;;A jointly developed outline paper sets out the parameters for cal- culating carbon emissions: All group entities record their greenhouse gas emissions in CO2 equivalents in accordance with the international standard based on the Greenhouse Gas Protocol (GHG), distinguishing between scope 1 (direct emissions), scope 2 (indirect emissions), and scope 3 (emis- sions in the value chain: business travel, commuting, paper consumption, waste generation, and water consumption). 8.5.
740;DZ_Bank_2022_EN;85;0;;;;;;;;;;;1 Climate strategy of the DZ BANK Group The DZ BANK Group’s climate strategy is focused on the reduction of greenhouse gases in business operations. The goal is to lower the aggregate volume of greenhouse gas emissions at group level by 65 percent by 2030 compared with the base year of 2009. All group entities have commit- ted to becoming climate-neutral by 2045 at the latest. This deadline constitutes the groupwide minimum target.
741;DZ_Bank_2022_EN;85;0;;;;;;;;;;;The group entities can try to achieve this emissions reduction more quickly on a voluntary basis. In addition, the group will include further sources of emissions in the calculation of its carbon footprint going forward, thereby raising the ambition level of its target. Compared with the base year of 2009, the DZ BANK Group – which employs more than 30,000 staff in total – had already cut its carbon emissions by 62.4 percent by the end of 2021 thanks to various action steps.
742;DZ_Bank_2022_EN;85;0;;;;;;;;;;;The main steps taken were the switch to green electricity and efficiency improve- ments in the generation and distribution of heat, a reduction in business travel, the partial transition to electric-powered vehicles in the company fleet, a shift toward online and hybrid events instead of in-person events, and a reduction in emissions attributable to commuting as more people worked from home.
743;DZ_Bank_2022_EN;85;0;;;;;;;;;;;The restrictions implemented in response to the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020 and 2021 also led to a marked decline in emissions caused by commuting, travel, and events. Although these emissions are expected to increase again after the pandemic, the group entities are taking firm action to counteract this effect.
744;DZ_Bank_2022_EN;85;1;;;;;;;;;;;In 2022, R+V and TeamBank were designated as cycling-friendly employers and at the start of 2022, Union Investment launched a CO2 calculator with which managers can monitor and manage the monthly travel-related carbon emissions in their area of responsibility (e.g. resulting from employees’ business trips).The DZ BANK Group reports the greenhouse gas emissions of its operations in CO2 equivalents.
745;DZ_Bank_2022_EN;85;1;;;;;;;;;;;These are primarily calculated using the emissions factors included in the cal- culation tool provided by the Association for Environmental Management and Sustainability in Financial Institutions (VfU) for the financial sector.
746;DZ_Bank_2022_EN;85;1;;;;;;;;;;;The process covers emissions that arise directly from burning fuels, including fuel consumption of fleet vehicles and loss of coolant (scope 1), emissions arising from the use of electricity and district heating (scope 2), and emissions arising from upstream and downstream activities in the value chain in connection with business travel, commuting, paper consumption, waste generation, and water consumption (scope 3).
747;DZ_Bank_2022_EN;85;1;;;;;;;;;;;The quantitative disclo- sures for scope 3 do not include emissions funded by finan- cial products, although by definition they belong under this scope and also account for the largest share ( › section 7.1 Impact transparency ). The data for the 2022 greenhouse gas footprint was not available by the publishing deadline for this report. The data is due to be available on DZ BANK’s website from July 2023.8.

For a number of years, DZ BANK has also been working toward the goal of reduc- ing carbon emissions through its business travel policy, which is regularly updated and amended, most recently in January 2022. Business trips in general, and especially domestic flights in Germany, are approved only if they are demonstrably necessary.
751;DZ_Bank_2022_EN;86;0;;;;;;;;;;;In 2018, DZ BANK started to engage more intensively with electric-powered transpor - tation, installing charging points at its sites and switching the company fleet over to all-electric and hybrid vehicles. In addition, DZ BANK’s company car policy stipulates that only Energy DZ BANK mainly uses district heating to heat its premises.
752;DZ_Bank_2022_EN;86;0;;;;;;;;;;;All major offices of DZ BANK AG, including Frankfurt, Düs- seldorf, Berlin, Hannover, and Stuttgart, use electricity that is generated exclusively from renewable sources. Electricity consumption at the bank’s offices reduced significantly in 2020 and 2021.
753;DZ_Bank_2022_EN;86;0;;;;;;;;;;;This was partly attributable to employees working from home more due to the pandemic but was also driven by a significant improvement in the efficiency of computing centers thanks to the replacement of outdated hardware and the optimization of technical configurations. In order to reduce the use of electricity and district heating even further in the future, the focus remains on the effi- ciency of buildings.8.5.
754;DZ_Bank_2022_EN;86;0;;;;;;;;;;;2 Environmental management All group entities have an appointed environmental officer who is responsible for environmental protection and for the implementation of climate targets in business operations. These environmental officers often have a team to support them. Some entities in the DZ BANK Group use environ- mental management systems that have been certified exter - nally.
755;DZ_Bank_2022_EN;86;0;;;;;;;;;;;The systems of R+V and Union Investment have been certified in accordance with the international standard ISO 14001 while the system used by TeamBank is certified under the Eco-Management and Audit Scheme (EMAS). DZ BANK also has an environmental officer who is responsi- ble for matters relating to operational ecology. With support from the environmental team, the environmental officer records relevant environmental data generated by DZ BANK’s own operations – i.e.
756;DZ_Bank_2022_EN;86;0;;;;;;;;;;;the operation of business premises, the vehicle fleet, and travel – and calculates a carbon foot- print on this basis. All the KPIs reported below relate to DZ BANK’s domestic operations and cover all its offices in Germany. DZ BANK is a provider of financial services, so it has limited influence on aspects such as water and waste in its own banking operations. For this reason, it only reports on aspects that are relevant with regard to its business activ- ities.

774;DZ_Bank_2022_EN;90;0;;;;;;;;;;;As at December 31, 2022, the entities of the DZ BANK Group employed a total of 34,355 employees (December 31, 2021: 33,459). The competition for professionals and managerial staff is increasing, so it is important for these companies to offer long-standing employees attractive prospects and also to recruit well-qualified specialists and young people.
775;DZ_Bank_2022_EN;90;0;;;;;;;;;;;All HR-strategy-related activities are based on the business and HR strategies of the cooperative financial network and the DZ BANK Group and their aim is to further develop the group as a leading financial services provider. In 2022, the DZ BANK Group expanded the nine guiding principles of the groupwide HR strategy – which also encompasses a joint remuneration and employer branding strategy and a shared management philosophy – to include sustainability aspects.
776;DZ_Bank_2022_EN;90;0;;;;;;;;;;;The Group HR Committee coordinates activities relating to overarching HR issues in order to exploit potential synergies. The members of the Boards of Managing Directors respon- sible for HR and the HR directors of the group entities sit on this committee.

777;DZ_Bank_2022_EN;90;0;;;;;;;;;;;The HR managers of the group entities also meet regularly in a standing committee to share their experiences. During 2022, two workshops on current issues were held in addition to the HR managers’ conferences. At the operational level, recent developments in HR within the DZ BANK Group are discussed in various working groups. The groups are organized by HR topic, such as staff development, young professionals, and remuneration, and meet at regular intervals.
778;DZ_Bank_2022_EN;90;0;;;;;;;;;;;There are currently six permanent working groups. They met several times in 2022, which meant that 27 working group meetings took place in total.

The Organizational Commit- ment Index (OCI) score stood at 79 (2021: 80). As well as providing an appraisal of the corporate culture, employees were also able to give their views on the bank’s sustainability strategy and share their insights and experience of diversity at DZ BANK and in their immediate working environment.

787;DZ_Bank_2022_EN;91;0;;;;;;;;;;;Employer branding The entities in the DZ BANK Group want to offer their employees a motivating workplace and encourage them to perform well and acquire new skills, and to be an employer of choice for the next generation. The objective of their common employer branding strategy is therefore to position the DZ BANK Group as an employer, to recruit and retain the right employees over the long term, and to safeguard its future viability.
788;DZ_Bank_2022_EN;91;0;;;;;;;;;;;A joint careers website, various public rela- tions activities, and employer branding campaigns are used to position the employer brand in the external job market. The measures are supported by the intragroup initiative ‘Employees recruit employees’. At DZ BANK alone, just over a third of all hires in 2022 originated from employee recom- mendations.

792;DZ_Bank_2022_EN;92;0;;;;;;;;;;;All entities in the DZ BANK Group offer their staff a wide range of internal training and development opportunities. They each define training objectives based on their needs and the focus of their HR strategies, communicate these objectives, offer continuing professional development (CPD) to all employee groups, and record key figures and the num- ber of CPD days for all their employees.

Since 2021, the two target groups – the 200 or so senior managers of the DZ BANK Group and the 600 or so executives at DZ BANK – can access a variety of learning and discussion events under the banner ‘leading, connecting, developing’.
794;DZ_Bank_2022_EN;92;0;;;;;;;;;;;The Corporate Campus also includes the cross-mentoring program, which develops the professional skills of participants, encourages them to establish networks across the group, and strengthens their identification with the entities. Under this program, heads of department (mentees) pair up with heads of division (mentors). In 2022, 17 pairs completed the program.
795;DZ_Bank_2022_EN;92;0;;;;;;;;;;;Under DZ BANK’s reverse mentoring program, the traditional roles are deliberately reversed: Managers pair up with young employees to learn more about Generation Z and about using social media, digital platforms, and collaborative tools. There were 24 such pairings in 2022. DZ BANK offered a good balance of online and class- room-based training in 2022. Team-specific training courses were offered in greater number too.
796;DZ_Bank_2022_EN;92;0;;;;;;;;;;;There was also a rise in demand for health-related courses, which tend to be orga-nized as online events. The video-based learning platform ‘Masterplan’, which helps employees to improve their digital skills, is used by almost all group entities and caters very well to the general trend for needs-based learning. Employees in Germany and internationally can choose between courses offered as part of the inhouse CPD program, division-specific training, and individual external seminars.
797;DZ_Bank_2022_EN;92;0;;;;;;;;;;;R+V expanded its CPD offering in 2022, for example in the areas of new ways of working, leadership, collaboration, agility, and health. The training is increasingly being struc- tured as a blended learning format, a model combining computer-based learning with traditional teaching methods. Employees can also access a broad range of video-based learning programs on a learning platform, including basic training on consumer protection.

As part of ’Verbund First 4.0’, DZ BANK launched a new version of the development program for high-potential employees (PFP+) in 2020 that facilitates both vertical and horizontal development paths, encourages participants to spend time in different parts of the business, and establishes alternatives to the conventional management career path.
801;DZ_Bank_2022_EN;93;0;;;;;;;;;;;39 employees began the PFP+ program in 2022. Bausparkasse Schwäbisch Hall offers established staff development programs for young professionals, future managers, newly promoted managers, and heads of department.

The remuneration policy is published on a consolidated basis each year in accordance with InstitutsVergV and the EU Capital Requirements Reg- ulation (CRR).
822;DZ_Bank_2022_EN;96;0;;;;;;;;;;;The institutions are also bound by the fur - ther-reaching regulatory requirements in InstitutsVergV. The entities in the DZ BANK Group comply with the German Remuneration Transparency Act (EntgTranspG), which was enacted to ensure equal pay for men and women doing equal or equivalent work, and published their first report on this in 2017. As the law requires companies to report every five years from 2018, the next report will be published with the management report in 2022.
823;DZ_Bank_2022_EN;96;0;;;;;;;;;;;The remuneration of employees of the DZ BANK Group generally consists of a fixed element and a variable element. The level of fixed remuneration is determined by market conditions, the importance of the employee’s role, and the employee’s personal qualities. Particular care is taken to ensure that all employees who are doing the same job, are of equal merit, and have the same level of experience are paid equally, irrespective of their gender, age, origin, or other characteristics.

At the institutions in the DZ BANK Group, measures are in place to ensure that variable remuneration does not exceed fixed remuneration. A departure from this rule is permitted only in justified exceptional cases and requires a resolution to be adopted.
825;DZ_Bank_2022_EN;96;0;;;;;;;;;;;Some group entities have capped variable remuneration at a level well below fixed remuneration. Vari- able remuneration of employees in control units as defined in InstitutsVergV (such as Group Risk Controlling or Group Audit) may not exceed 50 percent of their fixed remunera- tion.

828;DZ_Bank_2022_EN;96;1;;;;;;;;;;;It is the wish of all group entities – as reflected in their efforts to date – to design their remunera- tion systems in a way that is not influenced by gender. At DZ BANK, the remuneration of employees covered by collective bargaining is based on the prevailing version of the framework collective agreement (MTV) and the collec- tive pay agreement (VTV) for the local cooperative banks and the cooperative central institution.
829;DZ_Bank_2022_EN;96;1;;;;;;;;;;;The employees are banded into the pay groups defined in the collective pay agreement in accordance with the nature of their work and number of years in the role. This process considers the fol- lowing criteria: skills and expertise, ability to communicate, and responsibility. On December 31, 2022, 23.3 percent of staff at DZ BANK were covered by collective pay agreements and 76.7 percent fell within the non-collectively negotiated (NCN) wage sector.

973;DZ_Bank_2022_EN;119;0;;;;;;;;;;;by balance sheet and/or off-balance sheet) or by disclosing the number of cus- tomers and clients served.DZ BANK’s response: The DZ BANK Group forms part of the Volksbanken Raiffeisenbanken cooperative financial network, which includes more than 700 cooperative banks and is one of Germany’s largest private-sector financial services organizations measured in terms of total assets.
974;DZ_Bank_2022_EN;119;0;;;;;;;;;;;Within the cooperative financial network, Frankfurt-based DZ BANK functions as the central institution and is responsible for supporting the busi- ness of the cooperative banks in their regions. It also operates as a corporate bank and acts as the holding company for the DZ BANK Group.
975;DZ_Bank_2022_EN;119;0;;;;;;;;;;;DZ BANK focuses its strategy on the local cooperative banks with the objective of consolidating the positioning of the cooperative financial network over the long term as one of the leading financial services providers in Germany. Strengthening the market position of the cooperative banks is the most important prerequisite for their success. The partnership between the cooperative banks and DZ BANK is built on the principles of subsidiarity, decentralization, and regional market responsibility.
976;DZ_Bank_2022_EN;119;0;;;;;;;;;;;In addition to the local cooperative banks, the expanded focus of the DZ BANK strategy primarily encompasses corporate customers, retail cus- tomers, the public sector, international companies, and banks and institutions both in Germany and abroad.
977;DZ_Bank_2022_EN;119;0;;;;;;;;;;;These customers are supported by a broad range of products and services that include traditional financing, capital markets services, solutions for the capital markets, for investment, and for risk management, and transaction banking services (payments processing, card processing).
978;DZ_Bank_2022_EN;119;0;;;;;;;;;;;Although DZ BANK has customers in all 88 NACE sectors, around 50 percent of corporate customer lending is in the power generation, financial services, wholesale, retail, engineering, automotive, and food production sectors. 86 percent of the DZ BANK Group’s revenue was generated in Germany.References: DZ BANK AG 2022 Annual Finan- cial Statements and Management Report – business model and stra- tegic focus DZ BANK Group 2022 Sustainability Report 4.0 Company profile 6.1 Governance 7.4 Bank 7.

983;DZ_Bank_2022_EN;120;0;;;;;;;;;;;Since the spring of 2020, sustainability has therefore been treated as a key topic in the strategic dialogue within the DZ BANK Group and has been evaluated against the backdrop of the changing regulatory and market conditions. The strategic planning process was used to identify sustain- ability-related priorities for the individual group entities. DZ BANK developed its SDG classification and technology mapping methodologies in 2020 to add further impetus to its sustainability efforts.
984;DZ_Bank_2022_EN;120;0;;;;;;;;;;;They allow the bank to better understand its own impacts on the UN SDGs and the Paris climate goals and to adapt its business practices accord- ingly. The results of these analyses form the basis for positioning DZ BANK in the market as a facilitator of the shift toward sustainability.
985;DZ_Bank_2022_EN;120;0;;;;;;;;;;;DZ BANK plans to actively support its customers’ transformation processes, helping them to reduce adverse impacts and advancing the transition of the economy and society toward more sustainable ways of living and doing business.
986;DZ_Bank_2022_EN;120;0;;;;;;;;;;;DZ BANK has also set quantitative sustainability goals in order to align its sustainability strategy more closely to the UN SDGs and the Paris climate agreement: The ESG goals are shown in the figure ’Quantitative goals: Overview of current, updated, and new sustainability goals of DZ BANK from 2023 onward’ in section 5.1 of the 2022 Sustainability Report.
987;DZ_Bank_2022_EN;120;0;;;;;;;;;;;This overview also contains new ESG goals defined in 2022 with respect to climate alignment and decarbonization, employee satisfaction, and women in managerial positions. The first goal was to ensure that at least two-thirds of the corporate customer lending volume (loans above €1 million) of DZ BANK as at December 31, 2022 generated a positive impact on the UN SDGs. Moreover, DZ BANK wants to increase its financing activities in the field of renewable energies to €7.
988;DZ_Bank_2022_EN;120;0;;;;;;;;;;;1 billion by the end of 2026. As climate change mitigation is one of the most pressing sustainability issues, DZ BANK has made this a particular focus of its activities in 2022. Through the use of ’sector sprints’, DZ BANK has closely examined sustainability risks, decarbonization pathways, and the associated opportuni- ties in climate-related sectors. The 2022 Sustainability Report (section 7.
989;DZ_Bank_2022_EN;120;1;;;;;;;;;;;1 Impact transparency – decarbonization pathways in the energy, auto- motive, steel, cement, and aviation sectors, and climate alignment) and the 2022 regulatory risk report contain decarbonization targets for these sectors based on the findings of this analysis.
990;DZ_Bank_2022_EN;120;1;;;;;;;;;;;As DZ BANK regards frameworks such as the United Nations Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights, International Labour Organization fundamental conventions, and the United Nations Global Compact as essential for business relationships, the requirements of these frameworks have been integrated into DZ BANK’s rejection criteria and sectoral rules.
991;DZ_Bank_2022_EN;120;1;;;;;;;;;;;DZ BANK integrates the SDGs and the Paris climate agreement into its strategy by making voluntary commitments and participating in relevant initiatives. By signing the voluntary climate commitment of the German finance industry in 2021, for example, it undertook to align its credit and investment portfolios with the goals stipulated in the Paris climate agreement.
992;DZ_Bank_2022_EN;120;1;;;;;;;;;;;DZ BANK also joined the Net Zero Banking Alliance Germany – a coalition of seven German banks led by the Green and Sustainable Finance Cluster – in 2021. This initiative focuses on putting in place the tech- nical infrastructure and methods that will help banks to manage their portfolios in accordance with national and international climate goals.References: DZ BANK Group 2022 Sustainability Report 5.1 Strategy and goals 6.3.2 Sustainability risks 7.1 Impact transparency 7.

To this end, we will set and publish targets where we can have the most significant impacts. 2.
995;DZ_Bank_2022_EN;121;0;;;;;;;;;;;1 Impact analysis (key step 1) Show that your bank has performed an impact analysis of its portfo- lio/s to identify its most significant impact areas and determine priority areas for target-setting.
996;DZ_Bank_2022_EN;121;0;;;;;;;;;;;The impact analysis shall be updated regularly and fulfil the following requirements/elements (a-d)2: a) Scope: What is the scope of your bank’s impact analysis? Please describe which parts of the bank’s core business areas, products/ services across the main geographies that the bank operates in (as described under 1.1) have been considered in the impact analysis. Please also describe which areas have not yet been included, and why.
997;DZ_Bank_2022_EN;121;0;;;;;;;;;;;DZ BANK’s response: DZ BANK AG carried out an analysis of significant impacts in 2020 in accordance with the PRB specifications, as shown under c). The analysis was based on the SDGs with the greatest positive and adverse sustainability impacts on the basis of the sustainability impact classification.
998;DZ_Bank_2022_EN;121;0;;;;;;;;;;;Outcome: Five areas of significant sustainability impact (climate, environmental pollution & ecosystems, water consumption, access to food, and critical infrastructure) affecting seven selected focus SDGs (2, 6, 7, 9, 13, 14, 15). On the basis of these, a goal was set to expand the funding of renewable energies. A second goal is currently being developed. DZ BANK used its proprietary SDG classification system and a technology mapping process to carry out the impact analysis.
999;DZ_Bank_2022_EN;121;0;;;;;;;;;;;These are routinely applied to the classic corporate customer lending business for loans over €1 million as well as the debt capital markets business, securitization, and the investment book. Lending to corporate customers, the traditional core business of DZ BANK, is the ,main focus. SDG classification analyzes the contribution to the 17 SDGs made by business activities such as lending.
1000;DZ_Bank_2022_EN;121;0;;;;;;;;;;;Based on extensive research of relevant literature and deep industry expertise, a system of indicators at sector and subsector level was developed that makes it possible to assign a meaningful sustainability rating (positive, neutral, or adverse impact) to classifiable items. The aim is for the system to cover the full breadth of sustainability impacts across the entire ESG spectrum.
1001;DZ_Bank_2022_EN;121;0;;;;;;;;;;;The classification basically addresses the question of which customer activities are funded by DZ BANK, or which activities the customer carries out using the liquidity provided. In the case of funding for a specific purpose, such as project finance for a wind farm, only the directly funded activity is classified – in this case the generation of electricity from wind power. Where funding is not provided for a specific use, i.e.
1002;DZ_Bank_2022_EN;121;1;;;;;;;;;;;the customer may use the liquidity provided in any way it chooses, the customer is assessed as a whole, based on all its activities. In the case of general finance for an electricity producer, this means that the calculation for the customer – provided that the necessary information is available – is split proportionally in accordance with the power generation mix (renewables, gas, nuclear, etc.) and then classified accordingly.
1003;DZ_Bank_2022_EN;121;1;;;;;;;;;;;The end result is that an economic activity can have both positive and adverse impacts on various SDGs and therefore also vary in terms of the volume of the renewable energies reported (› section 5.1 Strategy and goals). This reflects the complex and diverse reality of SDG impacts.References: DZ BANK Group 2022 Sustainability Report 5.1 Strategy and goals 7.
1004;DZ_Bank_2022_EN;121;1;;;;;;;;;;;1 Impact transparency b) Portfolio composition: Has your bank considered the composition of its portfolio (in %) in the analysis? Please provide proportional com- position of your portfolio globally and per geographical scope i) by sectors & industries for business, corporate and investment bank- ing portfolios (i.e. sector exposure or industry breakdown in %), and/ or ii) by products & services and by types of customers for consumer and retail banking portfolios.
1005;DZ_Bank_2022_EN;121;1;;;;;;;;;;;If your bank has taken another approach to determine the bank’s scale of exposure, please elaborate, to show how you have considered where the bank’s core business/major activities lie in terms of indus- tries or sectors.DZ BANK’s response: SDG classification and technology mapping were introduced at DZ BANK in 2020.
1006;DZ_Bank_2022_EN;121;1;;;;;;;;;;;These approaches were used to analyze the corporate cus- tomer lending business (referred to below as analyzed classification portfolio) from the corporate banking and structured finance relationship management units, which includes working capital finance and project finance and thus represents only a selection of all DZ BANK assets. A particular focus when selecting the portfolio was longevity, as it is a core aspect of sustainability.
1007;DZ_Bank_2022_EN;121;1;;;;;;;;;;;On this basis, transactions that are usually of a short-term nature (e.g. money market loans) were excluded, although overdraft facilities were an exception to this rule, Transactions where DZ BANK is not directly involved as the funding partner (e.g. pass-through loans) were also excluded.
1008;DZ_Bank_2022_EN;121;2;;;;;;;;;;;In developing the SDG classification, DZ BANK initially focused on the largest sectors in terms of volume, as well as the sectors that typically have the most significant sustainability impactsThe classification was then extended to all other sectors to give DZ BANK a complete picture of the sus- tainability impacts financed by the portfolio. Details of the portfolio’s composition are shown under Principle 1 and the adjacent references.
1009;DZ_Bank_2022_EN;121;2;;;;;;;;;;;A percentage breakdown of impacts by sector and product/service is currently being developed and is expected to be published in 2023.References: DZ BANK Group 2022 Sustainability Report 7.1 Impact transparency | | | | | | | |Contents Company profile Strategy Corporate management Business portfolio Business processes Employees Corporate citizenship Annex121 DZ BANK 2022 Sustainability Report.

Please describe how these have been considered, including what stakeholders you have engaged to help inform this element of the impact analysis.
1011;DZ_Bank_2022_EN;122;0;;;;;;;;;;;DZ BANK’s response: In addition to the volume-related angle, the analysis of significant impact is based on three central perspectives: 1) Sustainability challenges and priorities of the countries in which DZ BANK operates. The data from the UNEP FI impact tool is used for this 2) Sustainability challenges and priorities of the DZ BANK stakeholders.
1012;DZ_Bank_2022_EN;122;0;;;;;;;;;;;This draws on the materiality assessment carried out as part of the sus- tainability reporting 3) Sustainability challenges and priorities of the general public.

1014;DZ_Bank_2022_EN;122;0;;;;;;;;;;;DZ BANK’s response: Based on the findings of the SDG classification and the findings of the impact analysis, DZ BANK has identified the following significant positive or adverse impacts or SDG impacts in the credit portfolio: climate change mitigation, environmental pollution and ecosystems, water consump- tion, access to food, and critical infrastructure.
1015;DZ_Bank_2022_EN;122;0;;;;;;;;;;;Climate (SDG 7, 13): Positive/adverse climate impacts through funding in particular of renewable energies/fossil fuels, combustion engines, energy efficiency, emissions intrinsic to processes, train/bus/public transport Environmental pollution and ecosystems (SDG 6, 14, 15): Pollution of ecosystems through the funding, in particular, of shipping, microplastic emissions, agriculture (over-fertilization, pesticides, etc.
1016;DZ_Bank_2022_EN;122;0;;;;;;;;;;;"), mining, deforestation/controversies Water consumption (SDG 6, 14): Financing of water-intensive manufacturing processes (such as paper, livestock farming) and plant and machinery with high cooling requirements (e.g. chemicals industry) Access to food (SDG 2): esp. healthy food; impact via financing of agriculture, manufacturing or trade Critical infrastructure (SDG 9): Financing of e.g."
1017;DZ_Bank_2022_EN;122;0;;;;;;;;;;;electricity, transport, food, telecommunications (so far as there are no adverse sustainability impacts) Of the most significant impact areas, DZ BANK has prioritized climate change mitigation. This is significant both because of the volume and because of its relevance for the general public, the stakeholders, and the countries affected.
1018;DZ_Bank_2022_EN;122;0;;;;;;;;;;;To build on the positive significant impacts and reduce the adverse ones, DZ BANK has prioritized ’All other significant impacts“ such as labor and good corporate governance alongside ’climate change mitigation’. The focus on climate change mitigation and on all other significant impacts can also be seen in DZ BANK AG’s ESG goals (see Sustainability Report section 5.1 Strategy and goals).References: Sustainability Report of the DZ BANK Group 7.1 Impact transparency 5.

1023;DZ_Bank_2022_EN;123;0;;;;;;;;;;;DZ BANK’s response: – Climate change mitigation: Power generation is the largest individual sector in DZ BANK’s portfolio and accounts for the overwhelming majority of funding for renewable energies. DZ BANK has therefore decided to set objectives for the expansion of funding for renewable energies. – Other significant impacts: These are attributable to a wide range of impacts from different sectors.
1024;DZ_Bank_2022_EN;123;0;;;;;;;;;;;DZ BANK has therefore decided to make increasing the positive SDG impacts in the lending business a goal.

1029;DZ_Bank_2022_EN;124;0;;;;;;;;;;;DZ BANK’s response: The Paris climate agreement and the sectoral transformation pathways of the Net Zero 2050 scenario of the International Energy Agency (IEA NZE) are of relevance for the significant and prioritized impact area of ’climate change mitigation’. Physical CO2e intensities and the associated alignment with the IEA NZE scenarios are particularly relevant here, along with volumes in more climate-friendly technologies (especially renew- able energies).
1030;DZ_Bank_2022_EN;124;0;;;;;;;;;;;The UN SDGs are the central benchmark for the significant and prioritized impact area ’Other significant impacts’. Here, the per - centage share of the total lending volume of the corporate customer lending business (for loans > €1 million) of DZ BANK generating a positive impact on the SDGs is the central indicator, with the target set at at least 2/3.

1080;DZ_Bank_2022_EN;129;0;;;;;;;;;;;DZ BANK’s response: The DZ BANK Group is committed to the UN Global Compact’s ten universally accepted principles of responsible conduct in relation to human rights, labor standards, the environment, and anti-corruption. These principles provide a central framework for the business activities of the DZ BANK Group and form the basis of the groupwide code of conduct.
1082;DZ_Bank_2022_EN;129;0;;;;;;;;;;;The code of conduct addresses undesirable business practices, makes reference to vari- ous fraud prevention tools, and provides a binding framework guiding the actions of all employees. DZ BANK provides regular training for its employees on compliance, prevention of money laundering and terrorist financing, fraud prevention, data protection and information security, and prevention of market manipulation.
1083;DZ_Bank_2022_EN;129;0;;;;;;;;;;;In order to build up the sustainability expertise of its own employees, DZ BANK has developed a foundation training course in sustainability as well as a training course in sustainability sales. The Supervisory Board received further internal training on sustainability matters in 2022. DZ BANK ensures that its employees are paid fairly.

1088;DZ_Bank_2022_EN;129;1;;;;;;;;;;;DZ BANK’s response: The DZ BANK code of conduct requires all executives and employees to act in compliance with the law and ethical standards. The code of con- duct is based on the ten globally applicable principles of the UN Global Compact, covering the areas of human rights, labor standards, the envi- ronment, and anti-corruption. It also addresses undesirable business practices and makes reference to various fraud prevention tools.
1089;DZ_Bank_2022_EN;129;1;;;;;;;;;;;With regard to sustainability-related risks arising from its own business activities, DZ BANK uses various concepts that are designed to minimize potentially adverse sustainability impacts and mitigate potential risks. These include rejection criteria, sectoral rules, the group credit standard on the consideration of risks associated with ESG factors, and the sustainability checklist for lending.
1090;DZ_Bank_2022_EN;129;1;;;;;;;;;;;As part of the credit check process, DZ BANK uses this checklist to assess loan applications in respect of environmental, social, and ethical risks. Large-scale project finance transactions are subject to the Equator Principles and are assessed for compliance with the World Bank’s IFC Performance Standards. The SDG classification tool highlights positive, adverse, and neutral impacts of business activities on sustainable development.
1091;DZ_Bank_2022_EN;129;1;;;;;;;;;;;The resulting picture can be used to conduct an initial evaluation of potential associated reputational risks. Since July 2022, risks associated with ESG factors have also had to be included in regular and ad hoc credit control, where relevant. As part of the sustainability program, the tools for assessing sustainability aspects and ESG risks are being refined and supplemented with quantitative methods.
1092;DZ_Bank_2022_EN;129;2;;;;;;;;;;;The ESG risk scorecard currently being developed, plus the integrated ESG questionnaire, was trialed by customers in selected pilot sectors at the end of 2022.
