28;DekaBank_Deutsche_Girozentrale_2022_EN;7;0;;;;;;;;;;; Table of contents 7 1. Foreword Dear Ladies and Gentlemen, at this time, we are faced with enormous challenges as well as opportunities in Germany and in Europe. Firstly, Russia's war of aggression on Ukraine worries and unsettles us all. The escalation of violence and threat to a peaceful country pose a serious challenge to European security. It is now more important than ever that the global community works closely together to achieve a peaceful solution and protect the Eu- ropean continent.
29;DekaBank_Deutsche_Girozentrale_2022_EN;7;0;;;;;;;;;;;In retrospect, however, it is already clear that the strength of the attacked Ukraine, which was hardly thought possible at the end of February last year, and the solidarity of the NATO states and the E U with Ukraine, which was also barely conceivable at first, will have their place in the history books. In addition, inflation is leading to rising prices in these months and is affecting many people in Germany.
30;DekaBank_Deutsche_Girozentrale_2022_EN;7;0;;;;;;;;;;;Special measures continue to be required her e to help consumers and businesses to cope with these challenges. The past year has made it clear to us in Germany that, in addi- tion to the outlined challenges, climate change is also advanc- ing. Climate change continues to be one of the most pressing problems of our time and requires a swift and decisive re- sponse. It is clear to all of us that we must act urgently to pre- serve the planet for future generations.
31;DekaBank_Deutsche_Girozentrale_2022_EN;7;0;;;;;;;;;;;In Germany, the multi- plicity and interconnectedness of the crises is also evident in view of the significant increase in gas prices: it is important that we find sustainable solutions to reduce dependence on fossil fuels and accelerate the transition to renewable energies. Against this background, banks an d financial institutions have an important role to play in the transformation to a sustainable economy, and this also applies to the Deka Group.
32;DekaBank_Deutsche_Girozentrale_2022_EN;7;0;;;;;;;;;;;Banks and financial institutions can accelerate the transition to a green economy by investing in renewable ene rgies and sustainable projects. In addition, they can make a positive contribution to reducing CO 2 emissions and promoting a green economy through their financing decisions. For the Deka Group, sustainability is an important part of its business policy an d its responsibility as a financial service pro- vider.
33;DekaBank_Deutsche_Girozentrale_2022_EN;7;0;;;;;;;;;;;In addition, its roots in the region and its understanding of its customers' needs enable it to offer innovative solutions and contribute to the stability of the financial system. The Deka Group contrib utes to achieving sustainable change by also aligning its investment decisions with sustainable criteria and supporting its customers in their sustainable investment decisions.
34;DekaBank_Deutsche_Girozentrale_2022_EN;7;0;;;;;;;;;;;It is also an active participant in the discussion on sustainable regulation an d is involved in the development of sustainability standards and initiatives. Overall, the Deka Group's activities demonstrate that sustainability is more than just a buzzword. It actively contributes to building a green and sustainable future by applying its resources and expertise to this issue as well. In this context, regulation naturally plays an important role.
35;DekaBank_Deutsche_Girozentrale_2022_EN;7;1;;;;;;;;;;;This is also evident in this year's Deka Group Sustainability Re- port. Through an example, I would like to point out three im- portant initiatives that are of particular concern to the Deka Group: TCFD (Task Force on Climate -related Financial Disclo- sures), CRR (Capital Requirements Regulation) and the EU tax- onomy. The implementation of these important initiatives is no longer just a small part of the Deka Group's day -to-day busi- ness.
36;DekaBank_Deutsche_Girozentrale_2022_EN;7;1;;;;;;;;;;;These initiatives can help meet the challenges of climate change while protecting or even contributing to economic growth. But this also shows that the transformation to a sus- tainable world can only be achieve d by everyone together – and not through the financial industry alone. In summary, I would like to say that despite all the challenges we face, we also see great opportunities. Let us take on the challenges and seize the opportunity to build a better future. Yours sincerely, Dr.
37;DekaBank_Deutsche_Girozentrale_2022_EN;7;1;;;;;;;;;;;Georg Stocker Chairman of the Board of Management.
38;DekaBank_Deutsche_Girozentrale_2022_EN;8;0;;;;;;;;;;; Table of contents 8 Sustainability strategy.
39;DekaBank_Deutsche_Girozentrale_2022_EN;9;0;;;;;;;;;;; Table of contents 9 2. Sustainability strategy With its guidance on climate and environmental risks, the European Central Bank (ECB) formulated clear expectations in 2020 for the banks it supervises to deal systematically with the causes and consequences of climate change and other environmental factor s.
40;DekaBank_Deutsche_Girozentrale_2022_EN;9;0;;;;;;;;;;;In November of the year under review, it specified these expectations to the effect that banks must reflect climate and environmental risks in their strategy, governance structures and risk management by the end of 2023 at the latest. Against this backd rop, the Deka Group also continued to develop its corresponding structures and processes during the year under review.
41;DekaBank_Deutsche_Girozentrale_2022_EN;9;0;;;;;;;;;;;"At the same time, the Deka Group does not view sustainability issues unilaterally as a risk, but also as an opportunity for its further d evelopment and the exploitation of growth potential. This conviction is reflected in the strategic action programme 2025, which focuses on ""Growth through sustainability"". 2.1. Business model 2.1.1. Shareholder structure and business segments DekaBank Deutsche Girozentrale (hereinafter referred to as ""DekaBank"") is a federal institution under public law."
42;DekaBank_Deutsche_Girozentrale_2022_EN;9;0;;;;;;;;;;;Together with its domestic and foreign subsidiaries, it forms the Deka Group. DekaBank is wholly owned by the German savings banks. 50 percent of the shares are held via Deka Erwerbsgesellschaft mbH & Co KG. The savings banks have pooled their shares in this company via the regional savings banks and clearing associations held by them. The other half of the shares is held by th e German Savings Banks Association (Deutscher Sparkassen - und Giroverband, DSGV ö. K.).
43;DekaBank_Deutsche_Girozentrale_2022_EN;9;0;;;;;;;;;;;Together with its subsidiaries, DekaBank is the Wertpapierhaus for the savings banks and supports the savings banks and their customers as well as institutional invest ors throughout the en- tire securities -related investment and advisory process. Through its activities in asset management and banking busi- ness, it is a service provider for the investment, administration and management of assets.
44;DekaBank_Deutsche_Girozentrale_2022_EN;9;1;;;;;;;;;;;The Deka Group's business model is characterised by the inter- action of asset management and banking business. As asset management products, the Deka Group provides securities, property and credit funds as well as certificates, including the asset management services based on these products for pri- vate and institutional investors.
45;DekaBank_Deutsche_Girozentrale_2022_EN;9;1;;;;;;;;;;;In this context, the investment funds in asset management and institutional customers are supported in their asset management as well as capital, liquid- ity and risk management. In this context, the Deka Gro up acts as financier, issuer, structurer, trustee, asset servicing provider and custodian bank.
46;DekaBank_Deutsche_Girozentrale_2022_EN;9;1;;;;;;;;;;;The Deka Group has classified its activities into five business ar- eas, each of which combines similar areas of expertise: The Se- curities Asset Management and R eal Estate Asset Management business areas cover asset management activities. The Capital Markets and Financing business areas cover the Deka Group's banking business. The fifth business area, Asset Management Services, provides banking services for asset management.
47;DekaBank_Deutsche_Girozentrale_2022_EN;9;1;;;;;;;;;;;The Savings Banks Sales, Private Banking and Wealth Management as well as Institutional Customer Sales units form the interface with sales partners and customers. The corporate centres sup- port the business areas and sales units along the entire value chain. ( CF. FIGURE 1 ) 2.1.2. Board of Management and Board of Directors DekaBank is managed with overall responsibility by the Board of Management.
48;DekaBank_Deutsche_Girozentrale_2022_EN;9;1;;;;;;;;;;;It steers and manages the entire Deka Group holistically, taking into account the strategic direction and risks. The management model is based on the principle of divi- sional responsibility. The Board of Management currently con- sists of six members with the following responsibilities: ■ Chairman (CEO): Dr. Georg Stocker ■ Vice Chairman & Asset Management: Dr.
49;DekaBank_Deutsche_Girozentrale_2022_EN;9;1;;;;;;;;;;;Matthias Danne ■ Risk (CRO): Birgit Dietl -Benzin ■ Finance (CFO) & Operations (COO): Daniel Kapffer ■ Sales: Torsten Knapmeyer ■ Banking Business: Martin K. Müller The Board of Directors supervises and cont rols the Board of Management. Its members are appointed by the Annual Gen- eral Meeting.
50;DekaBank_Deutsche_Girozentrale_2022_EN;9;2;;;;;;;;;;;It is composed of representatives of the share- holders, employees and representatives of the Bundesver- einigung der kommunalen Spitzenverbände (Federal Associa- tion of Cent ral Municipal Organisations, with an advisory vote). The Board of Directors works both in plenary sessions and in various committees: ■ Presidential and Nominating Committee ■ Audit Committee ■ Risk and Credit Committee ■ Remuneration Control Committee.
51;DekaBank_Deutsche_Girozentrale_2022_EN;10;0;;;;;;;;;;; Table of contents 10 Sustainability strategy Business model INTEGRATED BUSINESS MODEL OF THE DEKA GROUP (FIGURE 1) back to text DekaBank has several sets of rules governing the composition of the Board of Management and Board of Directors (Suitabil- ity Guideline for the Board of Directors, Succession Guideline for the Board of Directors and the Board of Management, Di- versity Guideline for t he Board of Directors and the Board of Management).
52;DekaBank_Deutsche_Girozentrale_2022_EN;10;0;;;;;;;;;;;The appointment procedure for the Board of Management be- gins with a referral to the Presidential and Nominating Com- mittee (PNA), which discusses the requirements and job profile tailored to the respecti ve position. It advises on the further procedure, e.g. the possible commissioning of a personnel consultancy, and discusses whether suitable internal candi- dates are available.
53;DekaBank_Deutsche_Girozentrale_2022_EN;10;0;;;;;;;;;;;The discussion in the PNA results in a rec- ommendation to the Board of Directors, which takes the ap- propriate decisions to start the search for a candidate. A short list of possible candidates is drawn up, which is used for initial interviews. Based on the interviews, two to three candidates with the best suitability are identified, w ho then present themselves personally in a PNA meeting.
54;DekaBank_Deutsche_Girozentrale_2022_EN;10;0;;;;;;;;;;;The PNA makes a recommendation for a candidate (nomination) and gives the Chairperson of the Board of Directors the negotiating mandate for contract talks. The nominated person introduces himself/hers elf to the Board of Directors. Subsequently, the Board of Directors decides on the appointment as a member of the Board of Directors.
55;DekaBank_Deutsche_Girozentrale_2022_EN;10;0;;;;;;;;;;;Prior to a new term of office for the Board of Directors, the PNA conducts a review of the composition of the Board of Di- rectors, including the coverage of areas of knowledge relevant to DekaBank in the future and the balance and diversity of knowledge, individual and collective suitability, skills and expe- rience. The PNA also takes into account the criteria and objec- tives s et out in the Suitability Guideline and the Diversity Guideline.
56;DekaBank_Deutsche_Girozentrale_2022_EN;10;0;;;;;;;;;;;On this basis, the PNA makes recommendations for the composition of the Board of Directors. With reference to these recommendations, the shareholders are asked to propose suitable candidates for election by the Annual General Meeting. The same applies to the appoint- ment procedures for the employee representatives and the three (advisory) representatives of the Bundesvereinigung der kommunalen Spitzenverbände.
57;DekaBank_Deutsche_Girozentrale_2022_EN;10;0;;;;;;;;;;;In a further step, the PNA then provides an assessment of all candidates proposed to the Annual General Meeting for elec- tion to the Board of Directors for the next term of office. The same applies in the case of necessary by -elections. The PNA also assesses whether the collective compete nce profile of the Board of Directors will continue to be appropriate in the future in view of the Deka Group's business activities and the market and regulatory environment.
58;DekaBank_Deutsche_Girozentrale_2022_EN;10;0;;;;;;;;;;;On this basis, it makes a recom- mendation to the Board of Directors. The Board of Directors then makes a recommendation to the Annual General Meet- ing. At least once a year, the Board of Directors reviews the com- position of the Board of Directors and the Board of Manage- ment. The focus is on an assessment of the collective knowledge, ski lls and experience as well as the cooperation between and among the two boards.
59;DekaBank_Deutsche_Girozentrale_2022_EN;10;1;;;;;;;;;;;The review is usually carried out on the basis of a survey with the members of the Board of Directors in accordance with the guidelines of the European Banking Authority (EBA) on the as- sessment of the suitability of members of the management body and key function holders.
60;DekaBank_Deutsche_Girozentrale_2022_EN;11;0;;;;;;;;;;; Table of contents 11 Sustainability strategy Cornerstones The questionnaire used is approved by the PNA. The PNA dis- cusses the results of the survey, advises on possible actions on any identified learning areas and makes recommendations to the Board of Management. 2.2. Cornerstones of the sustainability strategy 2.2.1. Growth through sustainability – strategic action programme 2025 The roots of the Deka Group's sustainability management lie in the area of environmental management.
61;DekaBank_Deutsche_Girozentrale_2022_EN;11;0;;;;;;;;;;;Building on relevant preparatory work, the Deka Group introduced an environmen- tal management system certified according to DIN EN ISO 14001 back in 2009. In the same year, it published its first sus- tainability report, which alread y met the comprehensive re- quirements of the Global Reporting Initiative (GRI).
62;DekaBank_Deutsche_Girozentrale_2022_EN;11;0;;;;;;;;;;;Since the 2014 year under review, and thus already four years before the CSR Guidelines Implementation Act came into force, the sustainability report has been audited by an exte rnal expert and its audit opinion has been published therein. Since the 2015 fiscal year, sustainability aspects have been an integral part of the business strategy and thus a core component of the business policy orientation, which is thus also transparen t to the Board of Management and the Supervisory Board.
63;DekaBank_Deutsche_Girozentrale_2022_EN;11;0;;;;;;;;;;;With the strategic action programme 2025, which the Board of Management has developed and carried forward since 2020 together with the managers and employees along the five fields of action 1. target -customer -oriented sales, 2. high-performance product & service range, 3. growth through sustainabili ty, 4. digitalisation & sustainable IT architecture and 5.
64;DekaBank_Deutsche_Girozentrale_2022_EN;11;0;;;;;;;;;;;modern organisation, process orientation & innovation, the strategic course was set to further develop the Deka Group as a customer -oriented, innovative and sustainable Wertpa- pierhaus.
65;DekaBank_Deutsche_Girozentrale_2022_EN;11;0;;;;;;;;;;;Based on the i nitial measures in field of action 3, sustainability as a basic principle of action continues to be actively promoted in accordance with regulatory requirements – for example through the EU taxonomy, the Disclosure Regulation, the ad- aptation of the Delegat ed Regulation on the Markets in Finan- cial Instruments Directive II (MiFID II) with regard to sustainabil- ity and the Act on Corporate Due Diligence in Supply Chains.
66;DekaBank_Deutsche_Girozentrale_2022_EN;11;0;;;;;;;;;;;"The numerous activities from the field of action ""Growth through sustainability"" have meanw hile been transferred to projects, initiatives and line responsibilities, where they are continuously developed further. For example, ESG governance within the Deka Group was restructured in 2022 to take ac- count of social, legal and business change process es. (CF.

72;DekaBank_Deutsche_Girozentrale_2022_EN;12;0;;;;;;;;;;;" Table of contents 12 Sustainability strategy Cornerstones FIELDS OF ACTION OF SUSTAINABILITY MANAGEMENT (FIGURE 2) back to text The main thrust for all activities is the Deka Group's stance on sustainability. It provides the framework for all sustainability activities and is the basis for integrating environmental, social and governance aspects (""ESG perspective"") holistically within the company."
73;DekaBank_Deutsche_Girozentrale_2022_EN;12;0;;;;;;;;;;;"It culminates in the following nine sustainability principles, which were integrated into the Code of Ethics in the year under review. ( CF. CHAPTER 5.1.1. ) These nine sustainability principles underline that the Deka Group sees sustainability as a permanent process for the holis- tic integration of ESG criteria into its business model; this ap- plies equally to its customers, the demands it places on its own organisation and its public activities."
74;DekaBank_Deutsche_Girozentrale_2022_EN;12;0;;;;;;;;;;;In this context, the Deka Group is addressing the political and regulatory as well as social and customer -related challenges as- sociated with climate change and sustainable development and has operationalised its sustainability principles into specific measures for the coming years in order to implement them. As a first step, the Deka Group has formulated qualita tive and quantitative sustainability targets. These will be further devel- oped over time and supplemented with additional targets.
75;DekaBank_Deutsche_Girozentrale_2022_EN;12;0;;;;;;;;;;;2.2.2. Fields of action of ESG management Based on its holistic understanding of ESG, the Deka Group has defined five areas of action for the management of sus- tainability -related issues and assigned them to the three ESG dimensions ( CF. FIGURE 2 ), according to which this Sustaina- bility Report is structured.
76;DekaBank_Deutsche_Girozentrale_2022_EN;12;0;;;;;;;;;;;"The field of action ""Sustainable Banking Operations"" includes in particular the management of the Bank's energy and resource consumption and thus also the direct climate -related effects of business operations. The ""Sus- tainable Products"" field of action focuses on the Deka Group's range of products and services in the areas of capital invest- ment and loans."
77;DekaBank_Deutsche_Girozentrale_2022_EN;12;0;;;;;;;;;;;"The Deka Group's human resources strategy and comprehen sive human resources policy measures are bun- dled in the ""Sustainable Human Resources management"" field of action. The ""Social Commitment"" field of action comprises the measures, with which the Deka Group fulfils its public duty to promote social developmen t."
78;DekaBank_Deutsche_Girozentrale_2022_EN;12;1;;;;;;;;;;;"Finally, the ""Sustainable Cor- porate Governance"" field of action brings together the measures aimed at complying with external regulatory require- ments and internal standards such as the Code of Ethics. Climate strategy of the Deka Group In view of th e advancing climate crisis, with its economic, political and social effects already visible in many ways, the Deka Group has also significantly intensified its efforts to combat the causes and consequences of climate change in recent years."
79;DekaBank_Deutsche_Girozentrale_2022_EN;12;1;;;;;;;;;;;In accordance w ith the regulatory framework conditions for dealing with climate risks, the corresponding measures cover not only the Deka Group's own business operations but also, in particular, economic activities in the areas of capital investment and financing.
80;DekaBank_Deutsche_Girozentrale_2022_EN;12;1;;;;;;;;;;;From 2023, these diverse measures will be brought to- gether in a group -wide, cross -divisional climate strategy, in which the Deka Group will document the risks and op- portunities of climate change and its position on net zero, as well as define targets and measur es that take into ac- count the specific characteristics of the Deka Group's di- verse business divisions.
81;DekaBank_Deutsche_Girozentrale_2022_EN;12;1;;;;;;;;;;;This also includes projects that the Deka Group and its individual business divisions have com- mitted to implementing as part of voluntary commit- ments, su ch as the Net Zero Asset Managers Initiative (NZAM).
82;DekaBank_Deutsche_Girozentrale_2022_EN;13;0;;;;;;;;;;; Table of contents 13 Sustainability strategy Cornerstones STRUCTURE OF ESG GOVERNANCE (FIGURE 3) back to text 2.2.3. Organisational anchoring As an organisation , the Deka Group is positioning itself for the future in order to be able to act in a risk - and opportunity -ori- ented manner. This includes the consistent integration of sus- tainability aspects into the organisational structure and pro- cesses.
83;DekaBank_Deutsche_Girozentrale_2022_EN;13;0;;;;;;;;;;;Potential susta inability risks in relevant business pro- cesses are systematically identified and managed. Regulatory requirements are implemented reliably and with a long -term orientation. To support this, the Deka Group has aligned itself holistically with the expanded sustainability requirements and adapted the Deka Group's governance system to the expanded ESG re- quirements.
84;DekaBank_Deutsche_Girozentrale_2022_EN;13;0;;;;;;;;;;;The focus here is on the organisational location of ESG-related r esponsibilities and the establishment of cross -de- partmental coordination and control processes. ESG governance Since 2022, the “ESG governance” target for the entire Deka Group has been successively established at organisational and instrumental level. ( CF.
85;DekaBank_Deutsche_Girozentrale_2022_EN;13;0;;;;;;;;;;;"FIGURE 3 ) In this context, new cross - divisional ESG decision areas with a significant strategic or eco- nomic impact were established for consideration by the Board of Management as a whole. In addition, the new ""ESG Circle"" format successfully established a group -wide platform for sys- tematic, cross -sectional and decision -preparing discussion of relevant ESG topics below the management body."
86;DekaBank_Deutsche_Girozentrale_2022_EN;13;0;;;;;;;;;;;Responsibility for managing the Deka Group's impact on the environment, economy and people is exercised within the framework of defined and decentralised line responsibilities and division of duties. In particular, responsibility for climate and environmental risks, or sustainability risks in the broader sense, has been assigned to the departmental responsibilities.
87;DekaBank_Deutsche_Girozentrale_2022_EN;13;0;;;;;;;;;;;"Decentralised, operational responsibilities also promote the ap- proach of systematically anchoring ESG requirements in the corporate culture. Strategic and group -related coordinative (cross -sectional) top- ics are managed centrally by the unit ""Strategic ESG Manage- ment"" within the Strategy & HR department. The translation or implementation of the strategic goals is decentralised at the level of the individual divisions and units."
88;DekaBank_Deutsche_Girozentrale_2022_EN;13;0;;;;;;;;;;;The tasks of opera- tional ESG management (sustainability management) include the coordination and implementation of sustainability -related reporting, including the present Sustainability Report, the drafting of statements on reputational risks, the support of ESG rating agen cies and the management of relationships with other external stakeholders, such as climate and environmental protection associations.
89;DekaBank_Deutsche_Girozentrale_2022_EN;13;0;;;;;;;;;;;"Topics and concerns from outside are systematically recorded and dealt with in a structured manner via the complaints ma n- agement in the unit ""Operational ESG Management"" via a content -related ESG allocation. Within the organisation, ESG controversies can be escalated to the highest governance body via the responsible line units, fixed project reporting processes, management committees or the ESG Committee, if necessary."
90;DekaBank_Deutsche_Girozentrale_2022_EN;13;1;;;;;;;;;;;This body, which will meet for the first time in 2022, consists of the members of DekaBank's Board of Management, the heads of Strategy & HR, Risk Control and Board Staff & Com- munications and acts as a decisi on-making and escalation body for cross -sectional ESG issues.
91;DekaBank_Deutsche_Girozentrale_2022_EN;14;0;;;;;;;;;;; Table of contents 14 Sustainability strategy Stakeholder dialogue and materiality analysis With this further developed location of new and overarching ESG issues, the Deka Group thus has additional information and decision -making formats at its disposal that support the holistic and efficient management of ESG issues in the Deka Group.
92;DekaBank_Deutsche_Girozentrale_2022_EN;14;0;;;;;;;;;;;"ESG dashboard as an internal reporting tool Relevant information is made available to the Board of Man- agement via the aggregated internal reporting called ""ESG Dashboard"". This enables comprehensive information and re- porting on ESG -relevant key figures and targets and creates transparency. The key f igures in the ESG Dashboard are sum- marised in three dimensions: 1. Sustainable business volume, e.g. in sales of products with sustainability features 2."
93;DekaBank_Deutsche_Girozentrale_2022_EN;14;0;;;;;;;;;;;CO 2 reduction, for example the development of green- house gas emissions in business operations 3. Sustainability perception, which is reflected e.g. in ESG rat- ings, but also in the satisfaction of employees or savings banks as the most important stakeholder group The content of the dashboard is actively developed in line with regulatory requirements and strategic ambitions and goals. 2.3.
94;DekaBank_Deutsche_Girozentrale_2022_EN;14;0;;;;;;;;;;;Stakeholder dialogue and materiality analysis The Deka Group's stakeholders include customers, employees, shareholders and supervi sory authorities, suppliers and cooper- ation partners, as well as representatives from politics, the me- dia and civil society, for example from non -governmental or- ganisations. The Deka Group uses a wide variety of channels to engage in dialogue with the vari ous stakeholders.
95;DekaBank_Deutsche_Girozentrale_2022_EN;14;0;;;;;;;;;;;These range from bilateral discussions and participation in confer- ences to active involvement in initiatives and associations. The dialogue with the various stakeholders and the survey of selected stakeholder groups enable the Deka Group to under- stand the impact of its business activities on the environment, economy and people, as well as to understand the issues and concerns of the various stakeholders.
96;DekaBank_Deutsche_Girozentrale_2022_EN;14;0;;;;;;;;;;;At the same time, dia- logue in particular offers the opportunity to explain its own position and thereby also build trust and acceptance for the Deka Group's activities. Surveys provide the Deka Group with a representative picture of expectations of its services and as- sessments of its service offering. ( CF. CHAPTER 2.3.1.
97;DekaBank_Deutsche_Girozentrale_2022_EN;14;1;;;;;;;;;;;) The exchange of experience and the joint development and implementation of climate and other sustainability -related ac- tivities are at the heart of the various memberships of the Deka Group and its subsidia ries. This also includes various voluntary commitments to take account of sustainability -related aspects in different areas of activity of the Deka Group, e.g.
98;DekaBank_Deutsche_Girozentrale_2022_EN;14;1;;;;;;;;;;;in capital investment through the PRI and the Net Zero Asset Managers Initiative (NZAM) or in sh ip financing through the Poseidon Principles. ( CF. CHAPTER 2.3.2. ) Sustainability rating agencies, which assess the quality of the Deka Group's sustainability management on behalf of instit u- tional investors, are also an important stakeholder in this re- gard.
99;DekaBank_Deutsche_Girozentrale_2022_EN;14;1;;;;;;;;;;;The criteria they use and the assessments of the Deka Group's corresponding measures provide valuable pointers for determining where the Deka Group stands and for further im- provements to the Deka Group's sustainability performance. (CF. CHAPTER 5.7. and ABOUT THE REPORT ) The results of the dialogues and surveys are incorporated into the Deka Group's materiality analysis.
100;DekaBank_Deutsche_Girozentrale_2022_EN;14;1;;;;;;;;;;;The aim of this analysis, as defined by the Global Reporting Initiative (GRI), is to identify the actual, existing a nd potential impacts of the Deka Group's business activities and relationships on the environment, econ- omy and people, including impacts on their human rights. Negative and positive, short -term and long -term, intended and unintended, and reversible and irr eversible impacts must be taken into account. ( CF. CHAPTER 2.3.3. ) 2.3.1.
101;DekaBank_Deutsche_Girozentrale_2022_EN;14;2;;;;;;;;;;;Stakeholder dialogues and surveys Regular surveys of various customer groups form an important basis for the Deka Group's s trategic development, particularly of its products and services and its sales focus. The Deka Group commissioned its own analyses and supported surveys conducted by the DSGV (German Savings Banks Association). In addition, DekaBank regularly conducts surve ys among its employees.
102;DekaBank_Deutsche_Girozentrale_2022_EN;14;2;;;;;;;;;;;Surveys of customers Wealth Barometer 2022 Together with the DSGV, the Wealth Barometer 2022 was conducted in the year under review, based on a survey of more than 4,800 citizens aged 14 and over in the summer of 2022. The result s of the survey show that the multi -crisis is of intense concern to German citizens. Thus, 75 percent of the respond- ents agree with the statement that the shortage of raw materi- als and the rising energy costs worry them.
103;DekaBank_Deutsche_Girozentrale_2022_EN;14;2;;;;;;;;;;;The proportion of respondents, who say this about the rising costs in many areas of life is just as high. 69 percent of citizens are unsettled by the effects of Russia’s war against Ukraine and climate change also continues to be one of the biggest concerns – here 57 percent of respondents say that the effects of climate change worry them. As in previous years, the topic of sustainability was also a the- matic focus in the current survey. 39 percent of respondents.
104;DekaBank_Deutsche_Girozentrale_2022_EN;15;0;;;;;;;;;;; Table of contents 15 Sustainability strategy Stakeholder dialogue and materiality analysis stated that they had already looked into sustainable invest- ments in detail or had even already invested sustainably. The proportion has risen by six percentage points compared to 2021. 56 percent of those, who have already looked into this form of investment consider climate protection to be im- portant or even very important.
105;DekaBank_Deutsche_Girozentrale_2022_EN;15;0;;;;;;;;;;;At 69 percent, the share of those over 60 is significantly h igher than in the younger age groups: only 51 percent of 14 to 29 -year-olds consider climate protection in sustainable investments to be (very) important. More than half of the respondents (55 percent) state that a government subsidy would increase their i nterest in sustaina- ble investments. At the same time, according to the study, there is still room for improvement in knowledge about sustainable investment.
106;DekaBank_Deutsche_Girozentrale_2022_EN;15;0;;;;;;;;;;;Only 20 percent of the respondents rate their knowledge as good or very good. This means that sustainable investments lag significantly behind general financial knowledge, where 35 percent rate themselves as good or very good. In the case of securities, 23 percent of respondents consider themselves to have good or very good knowledge, and 26 percen t in the case of old -age provision.
107;DekaBank_Deutsche_Girozentrale_2022_EN;15;0;;;;;;;;;;;Deka Investor Monitor 2022 Sustainability was also one of the topics covered by the Deka Investor Monitor, a representative survey of 4,500 German citi- zens aged between 18 and 75 conducted on behalf of Deka- Bank in July 2022. The results show a distribution between ex- pressed interest and actual activities that is quite typical for surveys on environmental and sustainability topics.
108;DekaBank_Deutsche_Girozentrale_2022_EN;15;0;;;;;;;;;;;Thus, 55 percent of the respondents expressed a fundamental interest in sustainable capital investment, while 11 percent have actu- ally invested sustainably. Almost one third of the respondents said they had never heard of sustainable investments, 36 per- cent of the respondents feel sufficiently informed about sus- tainable investments. Around one i n three (32 percent) said they would like to be actively approached by their bank or sav- ings bank advisor about sustainable investments.
109;DekaBank_Deutsche_Girozentrale_2022_EN;15;0;;;;;;;;;;;Survey of the savings banks as partners of the Deka Group As part of the DekaBank Expert Pool, DekaBank surveys over 600 managers and advisers from savings banks three times a year on various aspects of sales. In the year under review, questions on the topic of sustainability were regularly asked.
110;DekaBank_Deutsche_Girozentrale_2022_EN;15;0;;;;;;;;;;;The Deka Group's sales support services on this topic – from the training offered to final customer communication and products – received a high level of approval from the savings bank employees surveyed. In the November/December 2022 survey, for example, 86 percent of respondents said that the Deka Group provides the savings ba nks with sufficient support on the topic of sustainability in the form of qualification measures and sales support tools.
111;DekaBank_Deutsche_Girozentrale_2022_EN;15;0;;;;;;;;;;;82 percent say that the Deka Group as a company is credibly positioned in terms of sustainability. Survey of savings banks as institutional customers of the Deka Group As part of the triennial survey of s avings banks as institutional customers, an assessment of the Deka Group's sustainability performance was obtained in March 2022. A total of 176 con- tact persons from 144 savings banks were surveyed.
112;DekaBank_Deutsche_Girozentrale_2022_EN;15;1;;;;;;;;;;;88 per- cent of the respondents rated the topic of sustaina bility as (very) highly relevant for the capital market in general, while 72 percent considered the topic to be (very) important for their savings bank. Compared to the previous survey in 2019, the relevance of the topic has increased significantly: In 201 9, the relevance for the capital market was 54 percent and the rele- vance for the savings bank was 38 percent.
113;DekaBank_Deutsche_Girozentrale_2022_EN;15;1;;;;;;;;;;;"The savings banks are very satisfied with the Deka Group's sus- tainability offerings – Deka Easy Access, Deka Treasury Kompass, Deka Research Hub, Deka -Nachhaltigkeitscheck and Deka funds and certificates with sustainability features – with more than 90 percent of the respondents awarding the ratings ""excellent"", ""very good"" or ""good""."
114;DekaBank_Deutsche_Girozentrale_2022_EN;15;1;;;;;;;;;;;35 percent – compared with 23 percent in 2019 – were aware of De ka Investment GmbH's appearances at the annual general meetings of DAX companies, of which 98 percent gave them a positive rating. Employee surveys In addition to analysing the attitudes and activities of investors, surveys are also an important tool for systematically recording the assessments and requirements of the Deka Group’s em- ployees.
115;DekaBank_Deutsche_Girozentrale_2022_EN;15;1;;;;;;;;;;;To this end, more compact employee surveys, known as Pulse -Checks, were carried out as a strategic tool and also for the continuous, participatory and sustainable deve lopment of the Deka Group. The involvement of employees through Pulse -Check surveys is seen as a crucial factor in the achieve- ment of corporate objectives and the sustainable development of the Deka Group.
116;DekaBank_Deutsche_Girozentrale_2022_EN;15;1;;;;;;;;;;;Pulse -Checks give employees the opportunity to g ive their feedback on specific issues and identify areas where action is needed. In addition, the satisfaction and commitment of the employees are surveyed within the framework of Pulse - Checks. A structured follow -up process ensures that effective measures are developed for the identified potential for im- provement.
117;DekaBank_Deutsche_Girozentrale_2022_EN;15;1;;;;;;;;;;;As part of the Pulse -Checks carried out in the year under re- view, employees were asked about their perceptions and expe- riences in connection with the following topics: ■ Ongoing organisational cha nge ■ Sustainability ■ Diversity ■ Health ■ Risk culture.
118;DekaBank_Deutsche_Girozentrale_2022_EN;16;0;;;;;;;;;;; Table of contents 16 Sustainability strategy Stakeholder dialogue and materiality analysis Since individual questions were asked repeatedly over the course of time, the first effects of derived measures can be rec- ognised. For example, significantly more people agreed that they receive sufficient support in their daily work on a sustain- able lifes tyle than was the case a year ago.
119;DekaBank_Deutsche_Girozentrale_2022_EN;16;0;;;;;;;;;;;In addition, the high level of employee commitment is particularly pleasing: in all surveys, more than 85 percent of employees said they liked working for the Deka Group. Likewise, a large proportion of employees agree wi th the statement that all employees have equally good opportunities to make a career in the Deka Group. 2.3.2. Memberships and voluntary commitments 2.3.2.1.
120;DekaBank_Deutsche_Girozentrale_2022_EN;16;0;;;;;;;;;;;Memberships With its active membership in sustainability -related initiatives and associations, as well as its recognition of numerous volun- tary commitments, the Deka Group underscores its commit- ment to climate protection and sustainable development.
121;DekaBank_Deutsche_Girozentrale_2022_EN;16;0;;;;;;;;;;;In doing so, it is convinced that the goals of the Paris Climate Agreement and the Sustainable Development Goals (SD Gs) can be better achieved through constructive cooperation be- tween various market players, including competitors, by means of an open exchange of experience, as this is faster and re- quires fewer resources overall. The following list represents only an exc erpt of the corresponding activities.
122;DekaBank_Deutsche_Girozentrale_2022_EN;16;0;;;;;;;;;;;A comprehen- sive list of the Deka Group's activities is published on its web- site (www.deka.de/deka -group/our -responsibility/how -we- practice -sustainability/sustainable -corporate -management -at- dekabank/business --human -rights ).
123;DekaBank_Deutsche_Girozentrale_2022_EN;16;0;;;;;;;;;;;International initiatives In 2020, DekaBank joined the Principles for Responsible Invest- ment (PRI), the world's largest initiative by institutional inves- tors and asset managers to promote sustainable capital invest- ment, as an asset owner, thereby creating the conditions for the asset management companies D eka Vermögensmanage- ment GmbH, Deka International S.A., Deka Immobilien Invest- ment GmbH and WestInvest Gesellschaft für Investmentfonds mbH to join.
124;DekaBank_Deutsche_Girozentrale_2022_EN;16;1;;;;;;;;;;;Now that Deka Investment GmbH has supported the PRI since 2012 and the fund subsidiary IQAM Invest is also a PRI signatory, all the main companies in the Deka Group have committed to implementing the six principles for sustain- able investment. In the year under review, the PRI office as- sessed the Transparency Reports to be submitted by the signa- tories and then pu blished them on the PRI website.
125;DekaBank_Deutsche_Girozentrale_2022_EN;16;1;;;;;;;;;;;"Deka- Bank's Transparency Report is excluded from the publication, as it was prepared for the first time. As part of its PRI membership, Deka Investment GmbH also participates in joint engagement initiatives with other globa l investors. ( CF. CHAPTER 4.1.1.2.5. ) In this context, it already joined a PRI initiative on cobalt in 2019 and signed the declara-tion ""Investor Expectations on the Responsible Sourcing of Co- balt""."
126;DekaBank_Deutsche_Girozentrale_2022_EN;16;1;;;;;;;;;;;The signatories call for the respect of human rights and environmental standards in the extraction of cobalt. In 2021, the Cobalt Initiative was handed over by the PRI office and placed under the management of the signatories. Deka Invest- ment GmbH continues the commitments from this initiative and continues to address the risks at all companies, where the issue is relevant.
127;DekaBank_Deutsche_Girozentrale_2022_EN;16;1;;;;;;;;;;;"Since October 2021, Deka Investment GmbH and Deka Ver- mögensmanagement GmbH have been members of the Net Zero Asset Manage rs Initiative (NZAM), which was founded in December 2020. As part of this international alliance, the par- ticipating asset managers commit to supporting the achieve- ment of ""net zero greenhouse gas emissions"" by 2050 at the latest in the context of their act ivities, in order to limit the in- crease in average global temperature to 1."

130;DekaBank_Deutsche_Girozentrale_2022_EN;16;2;;;;;;;;;;;At the end of the year under review, around 300 asset managers with more than 60 trillion US dollars in as- sets under management had joined the initiative. Further infor- mation on the NZAM: www.netzeroassetmanagers.org . Deka Investment GmbH joined the UK Farm Animal Investment Risk & Return (FAIRR) initiative in 2018. The aim of the initia- tive is to raise awareness of the key ESG risks and opportuni- ties of the livestock industry through a collaborative investor network.
131;DekaBank_Deutsche_Girozentrale_2022_EN;16;2;;;;;;;;;;;"The main focus of the initiative is on ecologica l fac- tors such as the environmental impact of excessive meat con- sumption. However, social aspects such as socially acceptable sustainable development in agriculture (""just transition"") also receive attention. FAIRR also addresses the issue of sustainable food and its governance by companies, regulators and inves- tors."
132;DekaBank_Deutsche_Girozentrale_2022_EN;16;2;;;;;;;;;;;In 2022, Deka Investment GmbH participated in an initiative sponsored by FAIRR on the use of antibiotics in animal hus- bandry. Here, together with other members of around 20 global food compani es, Deka Investment GmbH called for greater transparency with regard to the use of antibiotics and possible resistance.
133;DekaBank_Deutsche_Girozentrale_2022_EN;16;2;;;;;;;;;;;At the end of the year under review, Deka Investment GmbH also joined another FAIRR engagement initi- ative on the impact of chicken and p ork production and their waste on the environment and biodiversity.

142;DekaBank_Deutsche_Girozentrale_2022_EN;17;1;;;;;;;;;;;Among other things, both compa- nies are active in the BVI’s highest sustainability body, the “Sustainability” committee, and provide two representatives for sustainability working groups. The AMI business division is also involved in the working group “ Sustainability in Real Es- tate Funds”. The aim of these committees is to further anchor ESG aspects in the asset management industry.

Deka Inv estment GmbH is actively involved in the Governance & Sustainability Commit- tee. The AMI business division uses its membership in the German Property Federation (Zentraler Immobilienausschuss e. V.
146;DekaBank_Deutsche_Girozentrale_2022_EN;17;1;;;;;;;;;;;, ZIA) to inform itself about and exchange information on current political and legal developments in the “Corporate Social Re- sponsibility” committee.

The voluntary commitments also regularly refer to in- ternational standards and regulations, which thus also become relevant for the Deka Group. ( CF.
150;DekaBank_Deutsche_Girozentrale_2022_EN;18;0;;;;;;;;;;;TABLE 2 ) In order to ensure that the voluntary commitments are suitable and feasible for the Deka Group and that it fully complies with the commit- ments, a group -wide process has been developed for joining and leaving the relevant voluntary commitments. The review, decision -making and monitoring process of the ESG commitments is b ased on five principles.
151;DekaBank_Deutsche_Girozentrale_2022_EN;18;0;;;;;;;;;;;A differentiated process is designed to ensure that, on the one hand, the goals and contents of the voluntary commitments are comprehen- sively fulfilled at all times. On the other hand, progress in im- plementing the voluntary commitm ents is to be documented and evaluated. Finally, possible non -financial risks that may arise from the signing of new voluntary commitments or within the framework of existing commitments should be identified at an early stage.
152;DekaBank_Deutsche_Girozentrale_2022_EN;18;0;;;;;;;;;;;Against this background, th e principles also stipulate that, in each case, the organisational unit that initiated or completed the commitment is responsible for its implementation. It is also in contact with the sponsoring organisations of the voluntary commitments to ensure that th e commitments made are ad- hered to at all times. In the run -up to each new commitment as well as annually during the membership, a review and as- sessment is carried out with regard to reputational risks.
153;DekaBank_Deutsche_Girozentrale_2022_EN;18;0;;;;;;;;;;;In ad- dition, a review is carried out to determine whet her the objec- tives and content of the voluntary commitment are in line with DekaBank’s stance on sustainability and therefore with the bank’s holistic sustainability concept. Before a voluntary commitment is signed, the Board of Man- agement of DekaBank or the management of the relevant sub- sidiary must decide on and approve such a commitment. In ad- dition, responsibilities must be clearly defined and docu- mented.
154;DekaBank_Deutsche_Girozentrale_2022_EN;18;0;;;;;;;;;;;These responsibilities ensure that the specific require- ments of the voluntary commitments are imp lemented within the units affected by the commitments. The relevant units and employees are provided with comprehensive information on the specific content and the resulting requirements for Deka- Bank or the individual subsidiaries, for example as part of f ur- ther training.
155;DekaBank_Deutsche_Girozentrale_2022_EN;18;0;;;;;;;;;;;The Deka Group regularly reports on the nature and content of the voluntary commitments it has entered into and the progress made in each case in its Sustainability Report and on its website (www.deka.de/deka -group) and Intranet.

175;DekaBank_Deutsche_Girozentrale_2022_EN;20;0;;;;;;;;;;;18 EU Taxonomy Regulation (EU 2020/852): ■ OECD Guidelines for Multinational Enterprises (MNE) ■ United Nations Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights (UNGP) ■ The eight core conventions on fundamental principles and rights at work of the International Labour Organisation (ILO core labour standards).
176;DekaBank_Deutsche_Girozentrale_2022_EN;20;0;;;;;;;;;;;■ International Bill of Human Rights The MSS assessment ensures that the taxonomy -compliant classification of econ omic activities not only examines environ- mental sustainability (compliance with the significant contribution to at least one of the six environmental objectives witho ut significantly compromising the other environmental objectives), but also that the minim um social safeguards pursuant to Art.
177;DekaBank_Deutsche_Girozentrale_2022_EN;20;0;;;;;;;;;;;18 of the EU Taxonomy Regulation are complied with by the company carrying out the economic activity. According to the Final Report on Minimum Safeguards of the Platform on Sustainable Finance (October 2022), which dev eloped and published a legally non -binding interpretation of Art.
178;DekaBank_Deutsche_Girozentrale_2022_EN;20;0;;;;;;;;;;;18 on behalf of the EU Commission, the following criteria are relevant: In order to comply with the MSS, it must be demonstrated, according to the interpretation of the report, that there is no breach of the four identified core issues of human and labour rights, bribery and corruption, taxation and fair competition, and that pro- cesses and/or measures are implemented to ensure compliance with the core issues. The Deka Group is compliant in al l four core topics.
179;DekaBank_Deutsche_Girozentrale_2022_EN;20;0;;;;;;;;;;;In its processes and measures, it ensures that compliance will continue into the future. To this end, the Deka Group takes the core labour standards of the International Labour Organization (ILO) into account when selecting suppliers. ( CF. CHAPTER 3.1.2. ) Furthermore, the internationally recognised principles in the area of human and labour rights are applied in business relationships. Violation of these principles leads to exclusion of the companies. ( CF. CHAPTER 4.1.1.1.
180;DekaBank_Deutsche_Girozentrale_2022_EN;20;1;;;;;;;;;;;) In addition, the Deka Group is aware of the importa nce of tax governance and tax com- pliance as an important element of supervision. As part of the Tax Compliance Management System, the Deka Group has implemented a tax compliance culture. The tax compliance culture prevents aggressive tax planning or artifi cial, abusive tax structuring without reference to actual economic performance. ( CF. CHAPTER 5.2.2.
181;DekaBank_Deutsche_Girozentrale_2022_EN;20;1;;;;;;;;;;;) In addition, the Compliance corporate centre raises the employees’ awareness of complian ce with legal and regulatory requirements. For example, the Compliance unit regularly conducts mandatory training sessions for employees. In addition, ad hoc training sessions are held on specific topics. ( CF. CHAPTER 5.2.1. ) Furthermore, the Compliance corporate centre is responsible for combating corruption.
182;DekaBank_Deutsche_Girozentrale_2022_EN;20;1;;;;;;;;;;;For example, the Deka Group has defined principles with associated processes and measures in the “Deka Group Fraud Preven- tion System” . The Fraud Prevention Forum regularly identifies and assesses the risk of corruption. 2.3.3.
183;DekaBank_Deutsche_Girozentrale_2022_EN;20;2;;;;;;;;;;;Materiality analysis Fundamentals of the materiality analysis As part of its reporting in accordance with the CSR Directive Implementation Act and the internationally recognised Global Reporting Initiative (GRI) standard, DekaBank regularly pre- pares a materiality analysis.
184;DekaBank_Deutsche_Girozentrale_2022_EN;20;2;;;;;;;;;;;The aim of this analysis is to iden- tify the issues that are material to the Deka Group from a sus- tainability perspective and to ensure that the Sustainability Re- port provides comprehensive and meaningful information on these issues. In the context of this report, the Deka Group takes into ac- count n ew GRI requirements for conducting the materiality analysis and thus determining the material topics.
185;DekaBank_Deutsche_Girozentrale_2022_EN;20;2;;;;;;;;;;;As part of a review of sustainability reports prepared on the basis of its guidelines, the GRI found that companies primarily adopt an “outside -in perspec tive” and primarily present how sustainabil- ity factors, such as climate change, affect their business activi-ties.
186;DekaBank_Deutsche_Girozentrale_2022_EN;20;2;;;;;;;;;;;Within the framework of the current GRI Universal Stand- ards 2021, which are the authoritative basis for this Sustaina- bility Report, the GRI ha s specified that in the materiality analy- sis, the effects of the companies on the environment, economy and people, including the effects on their human rights, are primarily to be analysed and evaluated (“inside -out perspec- tive”). According to this, “mater ial issues” are those issues that have the greatest impact on the three aspects mentioned.
187;DekaBank_Deutsche_Girozentrale_2022_EN;20;2;;;;;;;;;;;In contrast, the influence on the assessments and decisions of stakeholders, which previously also had to be taken into ac- count when determining materiality, is no l onger an independ- ent factor for determining material issues.
188;DekaBank_Deutsche_Girozentrale_2022_EN;20;2;;;;;;;;;;;Carrying out the materiality analysis Despite the GRI’s restriction on the importance of stakeholders in determining material topics, the perceptions of the Deka Group and its business activiti es by the various internal and ex- ternal stakeholders form a central basis for the materiality analysis. The Deka Group therefore makes particular use of.
189;DekaBank_Deutsche_Girozentrale_2022_EN;21;0;;;;;;;;;;; Table of contents 21 Sustainability strategy Stakeholder dialogue and materiality analysis surveys of the relevant stakeholder groups to identify their im- pact on the environment, economy and peo ple. Individual stakeholders can have several roles. For example, customers are an essential part of the Deka Group’s economic environ- ment, but can also be taken into account as part of the GRI di- mension “people”.
190;DekaBank_Deutsche_Girozentrale_2022_EN;21;0;;;;;;;;;;;The analysis of their expectations was l ast surveyed in 2021 as part of a study commissioned by the DSGV and DekaBank. As in 2016 and 2019, the survey was also conducted in 2021 by imug Beratungsgesellschaft für sozial -ökologische Innova- tionen. As part of a representative online survey, imug Beratungsgesellschaft interviewed a total of 3,011 people, who are at least partially responsible for banking decisions in their household.
191;DekaBank_Deutsche_Girozentrale_2022_EN;21;0;;;;;;;;;;;Of this population, 2,020 were customers of savings banks, 500 of whom owned securities at the time of the survey. In a ddition, 991 non -customers were surveyed as a comparison group. The online survey was supplemented by so - called live chats, in which two focus groups of 12 and 14 peo- ple respectively discussed aspects of sustainable investment. All members of the focus gro ups belonged to the population of the representative online survey.
192;DekaBank_Deutsche_Girozentrale_2022_EN;21;0;;;;;;;;;;;The focus of this survey with reference to the Deka Group was not only the importance of individual services, but also the perceived sustainability perfor- mance as well as the attractivenes s and credibility of sustaina- ble securities. A direct comparison of the results of the current survey with those of the previous surveys from 2016 and 2019 is not possible due to conceptual changes.
193;DekaBank_Deutsche_Girozentrale_2022_EN;21;0;;;;;;;;;;;Beyond this specific survey, conclusions about the percei ved impact of the Deka Group can also be drawn from the other surveys of customers and partners. ( CF. CHAPTER 2.3.1.
194;DekaBank_Deutsche_Girozentrale_2022_EN;21;0;;;;;;;;;;;) Against the backdrop of the new GRI requirements for deter- mining mate rial impacts on the environment, economy and people, the analysis and evaluation of the external surveys was supplemented by an internal analysis that looked at which spe- cific activities of the Deka Group have corresponding impacts in the sense of the afor ementioned “inside -out perspective”.
195;DekaBank_Deutsche_Girozentrale_2022_EN;21;0;;;;;;;;;;;To this end, the issues and activities that are material from the Deka Group’s perspective were summarised in a matrix, as- signed to the areas of action and assessed in terms of their positive and negative impact. In add ition to the results of the employee survey, the identification of the material issues and activities was based on ongoing projects to meet regulatory re- quirements as well as requirements arising from the Deka Group’s memberships and voluntary commitments.
196;DekaBank_Deutsche_Girozentrale_2022_EN;21;1;;;;;;;;;;;Results of the materiality analysis Based on the results of the various surveys and internal anal- yses of the negative and positive impacts on the environment, economy and people, the Deka Group has identified a total of eleven focus topics that have a s ignificant or very significant impact. According to the Deka Group’s analysis, five of these topics have an impact on human rights.
197;DekaBank_Deutsche_Girozentrale_2022_EN;21;1;;;;;;;;;;;In order to increase transparency regarding the results of the analyses and the identified effects, the Deka Group has als o changed the presentation of the material topics. Instead of presenting the five material topics in a matrix, the topics are presented in detail in tabular form in this report. ( CF. TABLE 3 ) For each of the twelve focus topics, the impact is specified and the extent of the impact quantified.
198;DekaBank_Deutsche_Girozentrale_2022_EN;21;1;;;;;;;;;;;Where relevant, the im- pact on human rights is also documented and metrics and measures for managing the impacts are identified. The table also shows in w hich chapter of the Sustainability Report fur- ther information is available on the topics identified as mate- rial.
199;DekaBank_Deutsche_Girozentrale_2022_EN;21;1;;;;;;;;;;;In addition, the content of the Sustainability Report takes into account the comprehensive information interests of the sus- tainability rating agencies and other stakeholders, in particular the supervisory authorities and non -governmental organisa- tions, for whom the report is a key source for assessing the Deka Group’s sustainability -related performance. ( CF. CHAP- TER 5.7.
200;DekaBank_Deutsche_Girozentrale_2022_EN;21;1;;;;;;;;;;;) In addition, the various conceptual and content -re- lated requirements resu lting from regulatory requirements, in particular the CSR Directive Implementation Act (CSR -Richt- linie-Umsetzungsgesetz, CSR -RUG), as well as voluntary com- mitments, above all the orientation towards the GRI standards as well as the requirements of the Germ an Sustainability Code (Deutscher Nachhaltigkeitskodex, DNK), must be met.

Sustainability communication Sustainability issues are an integral part of the Deka Group's communications strategy and are regularly communicated with all relevant stakeholder groups. The Deka Group informs stakeholders, whether shareholders, customers, employees or the general public, about sustainability -related events and de- velopments.
235;DekaBank_Deutsche_Girozentrale_2022_EN;23;0;;;;;;;;;;;The Deka Group uses the entire spectrum of avail- able communication channels. These range from the employee magazin e, press events and social media to sales and customer events. The Deka Group's website ( www.deka.de/deka -group ), which provides up -to-date information on the Deka Group's sustainability -related activities, also offers a comprehensive range of services. An overview of relevant subpages can be found in the imprint of the report.
236;DekaBank_Deutsche_Girozentrale_2022_EN;23;0;;;;;;;;;;;Employees of the Deka Group have access to an additional area on the Intranet, where information on th e Deka Group's sustainability activities is bundled. The Board Staff & Communications division is in constant contact with the specialist units in order to identify is- sues relevant to sustainability and to disseminate them through the appropriate communica tion channels. A central component of sustainability communication is the Sustainability Report.
237;DekaBank_Deutsche_Girozentrale_2022_EN;23;0;;;;;;;;;;;"Since the 2017 financial year, the Deka Group, like numerous capital market -oriented companies, in- surance companies and credit institutions, has been obliged by the ""Act to Strengthen Non -Financial Reporting by Companies in their Management Reports and Group Management Reports (CSR Directive Implementation Act, CSR -RUG)"", which was passed in spring 2017, to prepare a so -called non -financial re- port. Further deta ils on this can be found in the CHAPTER “ABOUT THE REPORT ”."
238;DekaBank_Deutsche_Girozentrale_2022_EN;23;0;;;;;;;;;;;The Deka Group applies the recognised guidelines of the Global Reporting Initiative (GRI) when preparing its Sustainab il- ity Report. Since 2013, the Deka Group has also prepared a declaration of compliance under the German Sustainability Code (DNK), which is published on the website of the German Council for Sustainable Development (RNE) ( www.deutscher - nachhaltigkeitskodex.de/en -DE/Home/Database ).

243;DekaBank_Deutsche_Girozentrale_2022_EN;25;0;;;;;;;;;;;In the year under review, this effect is onl y partiall y reflected in the environ- mental indicators, as the move wa s only completed in the course of the year and both the old and the new location had to be managed during a transition period. 3.1. Environmental management 3.1.1.
244;DekaBank_Deutsche_Girozentrale_2022_EN;25;0;;;;;;;;;;;Environmental management system To implement the environmental guidelines adopted by the Board of Management, in which the Deka Group commits to a sustainable business approach in economic, ecological and so- cial terms, the Deka Gro up introduced an environmental man- agement system certified to DIN EN ISO 14001 back in 2009.
245;DekaBank_Deutsche_Girozentrale_2022_EN;25;0;;;;;;;;;;;The environmental balance sheet, which is prepared annually as part of this system, covers all DekaBank buildings currently in use at the Frankfurt site (Trianon and the new LS 13 build- ing). The key figures on paper consumption relate to all loca- tions in Germany. The data on business trips is available for the entire Deka Group.
246;DekaBank_Deutsche_Girozentrale_2022_EN;25;0;;;;;;;;;;;The overriding goal of the environmental management measures is to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by five per- cent annually and to successively extend the coverage to all Deka Group sites. The functionality of the environmental man- agement system and the proper implementation of the associ- ated requirements are reviewed annually as part of an audit by the auditing company AGIMUS.
247;DekaBank_Deutsche_Girozentrale_2022_EN;25;0;;;;;;;;;;;The most recent monitoring audit of the environmental management system was carried out in 2021, during which the environmental auditor certified that the Dek a Group's environmental management system continues to be of a very high standard. 3.1.2. Procurement In the year under review, DekaBank's Strategic Purchasing pro- cured goods and services with a total gross value of 343 mil- lion euros (2021: 300 million euros) 10.
248;DekaBank_Deutsche_Girozentrale_2022_EN;25;1;;;;;;;;;;;Around 85 percent of strategic purchasing's contractual partners were commissioned in Germany, with the remainder from European suppliers. 10 Strategic purchasing includes the product groups consulting/office/business equipment, business IT infrastructure, services and personnel.
249;DekaBank_Deutsche_Girozentrale_2022_EN;25;1;;;;;;;;;;;When selecting suppliers, DekaBank has defined sustainability - related requirements for both the quality of the prod ucts and services purchased as well as the corporate governance of the suppliers and service providers. Key points of the corporate re- quirements are set out in the sustainability declaration, which the largest suppliers sign before entering into a business rela- tionship.
250;DekaBank_Deutsche_Girozentrale_2022_EN;25;1;;;;;;;;;;;In this declaration, they undertake, among other things, to comply with the core labour standards of the Inter- national Labour Organization (ILO). As part of a comprehensive review of the sustainability declaration in 2021, it was deter- mined that DekaBank's contractual partners are obliged to submit a statement and documentation if there are indications of violations in order to enable an assessment of the situation. By the end of 2022, 360 suppliers had signed the declaration.
251;DekaBank_Deutsche_Girozentrale_2022_EN;25;1;;;;;;;;;;;They represen t about 85 percent of the procurement volume in strategic purchasing. The remaining 15 percent relate to smaller consulting and software companies, for which the signing is waived after weighing the potential impact on the relevant sustainability aspects a nd the effort required to obtain and track the declaration. 11 All new suppliers are required to provide information on their environmental management standards and performance in DekaBank's purchasing portal.
252;DekaBank_Deutsche_Girozentrale_2022_EN;25;1;;;;;;;;;;;This gives procurement staff the opportunity to take relevant aspects into account when nego- tiating with suppliers. In the year under review, new sustaina- bility declarations were concluded with a total of 30 suppliers in the areas of consulting, personnel and IT.
253;DekaBank_Deutsche_Girozentrale_2022_EN;25;1;;;;;;;;;;;If DekaBank identifies breaches of t he requirements set out in the sustainability declaration as part of the regular supplier au- dits or learns of them through other means, the supplier is given the opportunity to rectify the identified deficiencies. If this does not happen, or if DekaBank co nsiders it to be inade- quate, a multi -stage process is set in motion, at the end of 11 In 2022, DekaBank ord ered products and services from around 1,300 suppliers.
254;DekaBank_Deutsche_Girozentrale_2022_EN;25;1;;;;;;;;;;;This in- cluded numerous small and one -off orders. The number of suppliers with significant sales (>1 million euros) is around 70.

In the year under review, there was no termination of a supplier rela- tionship due to breaches of the sustainability obl igation. Sustainability criteria are also very important in the selection of products and services.
256;DekaBank_Deutsche_Girozentrale_2022_EN;26;0;;;;;;;;;;;"For example, new energy -saving com- puters were ordered for the Deka Group in 2022, and the re- placement of the devices will take place at the beginning of 2023. The total of around 5,000 desktop PCs and notebooks meet the requirements o f the ""Energy Star"" eco -label in the current version 8.0 and the EPEAT Gold Standard. The new notebooks were procured including the CO 2 offset service of- fered by the supplier to compensate for the CO 2 emissions generated during production and delivery."
257;DekaBank_Deutsche_Girozentrale_2022_EN;26;0;;;;;;;;;;;The decommis- sioned computers are comprehensively refurbished by an ex- ternal specialist and resold as used equipment. The procured monitors also meet high energy efficiency requirements. Like the properties used by the Deka Group itself, the two data centres operated by external service providers, where Deka- Bank's servers work, are powered 100 percent by green elec- tricity.
258;DekaBank_Deutsche_Girozentrale_2022_EN;26;0;;;;;;;;;;;Here, DekaBank uses its influence on the service provid- ers to promote climate and environmentally friendly behaviour. The majority of the advertising materials are sourced from a supplier, whose sustainability management has been audited by Ecovadis. The supplier has also undertaken to take into ac- count the principles of the UN Global Compact and to report annually on its compliance.
259;DekaBank_Deutsche_Girozentrale_2022_EN;26;0;;;;;;;;;;;When s electing hotels to host events, DekaBank ensures that they are awarded at least one recognised environmental or sustainability seal, such as the Bi- osphere Responsible Tourism certificate, or have a certified en- vironmental management system, e.g. in accorda nce with EMAS or ISO 14001. The core range of office supplies was switched to exclusively ecological items at the beginning of 2021.
260;DekaBank_Deutsche_Girozentrale_2022_EN;26;0;;;;;;;;;;;These products are characterised by the fact that they are either certified with a recognised seal (Blue Angel, EU Ecolabe l, FSC/PEFC certificate) or consist of 100 percent recycled paper or were manufac- tured without solvents. In addition, the range includes items made of recycled plastic or with housings made of natural, re- newable and compostable cellulose. 3.1.3.
261;DekaBank_Deutsche_Girozentrale_2022_EN;26;1;;;;;;;;;;;Resource consumpt ion and waste As in the previous year, a special effect must be taken into ac- count with regard to the waste volume in the year under re- view. As part of the abandonment of the old business prem- ises in Frankfurt city centre and the move to the new location in Frankfurt -Niederrad, a total of 332 tonnes of electrical and metal scrap, discarded office furniture and waste paper were generated. To reduce the amount of waste, reuse was organ- ised wherever possible.
262;DekaBank_Deutsche_Girozentrale_2022_EN;26;1;;;;;;;;;;;For example, a large part of the furni- ture was sold to a subcontractor, who recycled some of the furniture. All companies entrusted with the disposal of waste hold a cer- tificate as a specialist disposal company in accordance with the German Act on Closed Cycle Management and Waste. Deka- Bank conducts regul ar audits at the companies to ensure that waste is disposed of in a safe and environmentally friendly manner.
263;DekaBank_Deutsche_Girozentrale_2022_EN;26;1;;;;;;;;;;;Paper consumption in the year under review was 574 tonnes, 203 tonnes lower than in the previous year (2021: 777 tonnes). The reason for the signi ficant decrease in paper con- sumption is that there were no regulatory mailings to custom- ers in the year under review.
264;DekaBank_Deutsche_Girozentrale_2022_EN;26;1;;;;;;;;;;;Dealing with the requirements of the Act on Corpo- rate Due Diligence in Supply Chains (Lieferketten- sorgfaltspflichtengesetz, LkSG) The Act on Corporate Due Diligence in Supply Chains (LkSG ) will come into full force on 1 January 2023. The aim of the law is to protect fundamental human rights in companies' supply chains and, in particular, to enforce the prohibition of child and forced labour.
265;DekaBank_Deutsche_Girozentrale_2022_EN;26;1;;;;;;;;;;;Environmental con- cerns are also relevant here if they lead to human rights vi- olations or serve to protect human health. In the first phase, the LkSG applies to companies that generally em- ploy at least 3,000 workers in Germany. This means that DekaBank also falls within the scope of the LkSG. The im- pleme ntation of the associated requirements will be car- ried out for DekaBank and its suppliers as well as for the subsidiaries, over which DekaBank exercises a determining influence.
266;DekaBank_Deutsche_Girozentrale_2022_EN;26;1;;;;;;;;;;;To prepare for the implementation of the law, the initial situation and scope of application for the LkSG were ana- lysed and the specific need for action was defined for DekaBank and the other relevant companies in the Deka Group. Responsibilities for the initial implementation of the legal requirements and for ensuring compliance wi th these requirements on a permanent basis were also de- fined.
267;DekaBank_Deutsche_Girozentrale_2022_EN;26;1;;;;;;;;;;;In the course of implementing the legal requirements, a human rights officer was appointed by the end of the 2022 financial year and a complaints procedure was set up in accordance with the requ irements of the LkSG. In 2023, further steps will follow to implement the LkSG, in- cluding risk analyses for the bank's own business division and direct suppliers.
268;DekaBank_Deutsche_Girozentrale_2022_EN;26;2;;;;;;;;;;;As required by the LkSG, DekaBank will also report transparently on the results of the analys es and the measures derived and publish the policy state- ment required by the LkSG once the risk analysis has been carried out. In addition, DekaBank will publish a declara- tion on its responsibility for human rights and the environ- ment in its supply chains as early as the beginning of 2023, which goes beyond the legal requirement.

Climate protection in business operations 3.2.1."
272;DekaBank_Deutsche_Girozentrale_2022_EN;27;0;;;;;;;;;;;Energy consumption of owner -occupied properties Reducing energy consumption at the Deka Group's sites con- tributes directly to reducing greenhouse gas emissions, particu- larly CO 2. Based on the results of the energy audits carried out in 2015 and 2019 in accordance with DIN 16247 and as part of the environmental management system, the Deka Group's Real Estate Management was able to impleme nt numerous measures to reduce energy consumption at the previous loca- tions.
273;DekaBank_Deutsche_Girozentrale_2022_EN;27;0;;;;;;;;;;;For example, the room temperature in the IT technical rooms was increased by two to four degrees, thereby saving energy in room cooling. Sensors monitor compliance with the target temperature of 23° to 25° Celsius. With this measure, DekaBank is also implementing a requirement of the banking supervisory authority, which stipulates that banks must contin- uously measure electricity consumption in the relevant IT rooms. Around 80,000 k Wh of electricity can thus be saved per year.
274;DekaBank_Deutsche_Girozentrale_2022_EN;27;0;;;;;;;;;;;A significant improvement in energy consumption as well as other consumption and emission values has occurred due to the commissioning of the new office building in Frankfurt -Nie- derrad, which is also referred to as LS 13 due to its address at Lyoner Straße 13. By moving out of the Skyper and Prisma buildings previously used and also partially out of the Trianon to the new location, which meets much higher energy and en- vironmental standards, energy consumption w as reduced by around 12.
275;DekaBank_Deutsche_Girozentrale_2022_EN;27;0;;;;;;;;;;;3 percent in the year under review compared to the previous year. The new building offers space for up to 3,700 employees on an area of around 47,000 m2. It features smart building tech- nology and efficient control of lighting and i ndoor climate.
276;DekaBank_Deutsche_Girozentrale_2022_EN;27;1;;;;;;;;;;;Both contribute to saving energy and thus to reducing CO 2 – for example through the use of heated -cool ceilings, humidifi- cation and dehumidification systems, façades that let in a lot of daylight and combined heat/cold protection for the win- dows, motion detectors for lights or instantaneous water heat- ers in toilets and showers. The heat is mainly obtained from combined heat and power.
277;DekaBank_Deutsche_Girozentrale_2022_EN;27;1;;;;;;;;;;;A photovoltaic system was in- stalled on the roof, and 100 percent of the electricity gener- ated there is used d irectly in the building. The other electricity for the building also comes entirely from renewable sources. The LS 13 building is equipped with 125 charging points for e - bikes. In addition, the installation of 24 charging points for e - vehicles is planned f or the first quarter of 2023. An expansion to 60 charging points for e -vehicles is already technically pre- pared.
278;DekaBank_Deutsche_Girozentrale_2022_EN;27;1;;;;;;;;;;;The flexible workplace concept with its combination of mod- ern workplaces with opportunities for retreat, lounges and ac- tivity rooms not only enables individual and needs -based use of the rooms, but also reduces the space requi red by around 25 percent compared to the properties previously used. In ad- dition to a significant reduction in energy consumption, this also results in significant cost savings.
279;DekaBank_Deutsche_Girozentrale_2022_EN;27;1;;;;;;;;;;;The office building was awarded DGNB Platinum certification for its comprehens ive cli- mate, environmental and social properties. Against the backdrop of the Russian war of aggression on Ukraine and the subsequent changes in gas supplies and possi- ble energy shortages, the Deka Group stepped up its energy - saving measures in the year u nder review.
280;DekaBank_Deutsche_Girozentrale_2022_EN;27;1;;;;;;;;;;;In the buildings used by the Deka Group, rooms are cooled to 25° Celsius dur- ing the warm season and heated to 20° Celsius during the heating season. 3.2.2. Traffic Besides energy consumption, business travel represents the most significant direct env ironmental impact of non -manufac- turing companies such as banks and is an important starting point for further reducing climate -relevant emissions.

A variety of plant species will be used, so that sedums, perennials and small as well as large shrubs up to multi -stemmed woody plants support biodiversity a nd fine dust mitigation.
282;DekaBank_Deutsche_Girozentrale_2022_EN;27;1;;;;;;;;;;;"All rainwater is temporarily stored in the green roof structures and made available for the vegetation on the roof. Excess precipitation water is passed on to an underground buffer tank to be subsequently returned to the natural wa ter cy- cle for groundwater recharge. In addition, the green roof promotes the natural evaporation process; this form of ac- tive cooling has a positive effect on the urban climate. In total, up to 2."

Business trips After business travel was affected by the restrictions associated with the Corona pandemic in the first months of the year un- der review, travel activity intensified again in the c ourse of the year after numerous protective measures were lifted.
285;DekaBank_Deutsche_Girozentrale_2022_EN;28;0;;;;;;;;;;;As a re- sult, long -haul flights increased by 183.9 percent and short - haul flights by 160.4 percent compared to the previous year. Despite the significant increases, the volume of flights was be- low the figure for 2019. DekaBank employees also travelled more on business by train (+50.3 percent) and car (+127.4 percent) in the year under review.
286;DekaBank_Deutsche_Girozentrale_2022_EN;28;0;;;;;;;;;;;"In order to further raise travellers' awareness of the preferred use of rail, a note has been integra ted into the travel booking system that explicitly draws their attention to the climate - friendly travel option with Deutsche Bahn when booking air travel. The new ""Green Traveling"" website, which the Deka Group's travel management team integrated into its Intranet site at the beginning of 2023, also provides information on cli- mate -friendly and sustainable travel."

288;DekaBank_Deutsche_Girozentrale_2022_EN;28;0;;;;;;;;;;;"In order to further reduce these emissions, the DekaBank’s Board of Management issued a mandate in 2021 to develop and implement a com- prehensive concept to gradually red uce the fleet's CO 2 foot- print: The aim is to reduce these CO 2 emissions by at least 40 percent by 2025 compared with the 2019 level; from 2028, the vehicles should then be driven without any corresponding emissions. An essential building block for achiev ing this goal is the expan- sion of e -mobility."
289;DekaBank_Deutsche_Girozentrale_2022_EN;28;0;;;;;;;;;;;In cooperation with Real Estate Manage- ment and Human Resources, Fleet Management has imple- mented a series of measures to increase the use of hybrid and especially e -vehicles. For example, on 1 March 2022, a mod el matrix for full electric vehicles was rolled out for the different groups of company car users, as well as an explicit order rec- ommendation for full electric vehicles. The model matrix lists vehicles that meet DekaBank's requirements and can be or- dered.
290;DekaBank_Deutsche_Girozentrale_2022_EN;28;0;;;;;;;;;;;The attainability of the target set for 2028 also depends on the extent to which the suppliers of full electric vehicles succeed in eliminating the supply bottlenecks and delivering such vehicles in sufficient quantities. In addition, further manufactur ers of petrol and diesel hybrid models have been added to the pool of eligible vehicles.
291;DekaBank_Deutsche_Girozentrale_2022_EN;28;0;;;;;;;;;;;Users of e-vehicles, who charge their vehicles at their place of resi- dence continue to receive either a flat rate of 15 euros per month for plug -in hybrids or 30 euros per month for full elec- tric vehicles or can have the charging costs reimbursed in full, provided they can prove the real costs by means of a meter that complies with calibration law.
292;DekaBank_Deutsche_Girozentrale_2022_EN;28;1;;;;;;;;;;;In addition, DekaBank pays a subsidy of 1,000 euros for the installation of wallboxes at the residential locations of those entitled to a company car. At the new location in Frankfurt -Niederrad, 24 charging stations are available, and a further 40 charging stations are technically pre-equipped and can be connected to the grid at any time.
293;DekaBank_Deutsche_Girozentrale_2022_EN;28;1;;;;;;;;;;;With effect from 1 February 2023, the leasing reference rates for full electric vehicles will be significantly increased in order to keep the ordering of these vehicles attractive for those enti- tled to company cars. In addition to the E -Smarts at Deka Immobilien Investment GmbH's regional locations, the Deka Group has a fleet of 98 plug-in hybrids and six pure e -vehicles as on 31 December 2022.
294;DekaBank_Deutsche_Girozentrale_2022_EN;28;1;;;;;;;;;;;At the same time, there were around 160 open orders, of which around 25 percent were for full ele ctric vehicles. Therefore, depending on the delivery times of the manufactur- ers, the share of full electric vehicles in the total fleet will in- crease significantly in 2023/2024. Bicycle leasing The bicycle leasing offer introduced in 2019 has been very we ll received by employees.
295;DekaBank_Deutsche_Girozentrale_2022_EN;28;1;;;;;;;;;;;Under this model, all permanent em- ployees of the Deka Group have the option, similar to a com- pany car lease, of leasing up to two bicycles worth up to 5,000 euros gross each over 36 months as part of a gross salary con- version. Par ticularly during the Corona pandemic, there was a high level of interest in the offer and by the end of the year under review, 974 bicycles had been leased by employees (2021: 942).
296;DekaBank_Deutsche_Girozentrale_2022_EN;28;1;;;;;;;;;;;It is particularly pleasing that the number of con- tracts has continued to rise, although the first leasing contracts expired after a term of three years. At the new location in Nie- derrad, 500 covered and lockable bicycle parking spaces and 125 charging stations for e -bikes are available for employees.
297;DekaBank_Deutsche_Girozentrale_2022_EN;28;1;;;;;;;;;;;Job ticket and car pooling Since 1 April 2019, DekaBank's Premium -JobTicket has been valid throughout the year in the entire region of the Rhine/Main Regional Transport Association (RMV) for bus, S - Bahn, regional trains, trams and underground trains and for any number of journeys in 2nd class. For business trips from Frankfurt to the Luxembourg office, a “carpooling calendar” tool was already made available in 2018 to support the for- mation of carpools. 3.2.3.
298;DekaBank_Deutsche_Girozentrale_2022_EN;28;1;;;;;;;;;;;Greenhouse gas emissions in business operations DekaBank's central goal in the area of environmental manage- ment is to reduce its o wn emissions by at least five percent an- nually. This figure is higher than the linear reduction in abso- lute greenhouse gas emissions of at least 4.2 percent per year on average, which is considered necessary by the Science.

This target was not achieved in the year under review. The ab- solute CO 2 emissions increased minimally compared to the pre- vious year to 6,234 tonnes (2021: 6,199 tonnes)12.
300;DekaBank_Deutsche_Girozentrale_2022_EN;29;0;;;;;;;;;;;Although electricity cons umption and district heating consumption were reduced with the move to the new building in Niederrad, this was offset by an increase in business travel and a partial ad- justment of the conversion factors. As in the previous year under review, the electric ity consump- tion of employees in home offices was also taken into account when calculating emissions. Compared to 2021, fewer em- ployees worked in a home office. 3.2.4.
301;DekaBank_Deutsche_Girozentrale_2022_EN;29;0;;;;;;;;;;;Compensation of unavoidable emissions In order to compensate for the unavoidable CO 2 emissions caused by its business operations, DekaBank has been offset- ting these since 2020 by purchasing reduction certificates from selected international projects. DekaBank is aware that offsetting greenhouse gas emissions through the retirement of emissio n rights is not without con- troversy.
302;DekaBank_Deutsche_Girozentrale_2022_EN;29;0;;;;;;;;;;;"For one thing, it therefore consistently ensures that offsetting is only regularly used when the currently possible measures to avoid and reduce emissions have been exhausted. DekaBank works here according to the princi ple of ""avoid be- fore reduce before compensate"". On the other hand, high standards are applied to the climate protection projects, from which the emission reduction certifi- cates for offsetting originate."

306;DekaBank_Deutsche_Girozentrale_2022_EN;29;1;;;;;;;;;;;Scope 1, 2 and 3 greenhouse gas emissions The GHG Protocol Corporate Standard classifies a compa- ny's greenhouse gas emissions into three scopes. Scope 1 emissions are direct emissions from own sources or those under direct control. Scope 2 emissions are indirect emis- sions from the generation of purchased energy. Scope 3 emissions ar e all indirect emissions that occur in the re- porting company's value chain and are not included in Scope 2 emissions.
307;DekaBank_Deutsche_Girozentrale_2022_EN;29;1;;;;;;;;;;;This includes upstream and down- stream emissions. DekaBank supports savings banks on the path to greater sustainability Based on its own experience, DekaBank has developed an offer to support the savings banks in determining and off- setting their emissions from business operations.

309;DekaBank_Deutsche_Girozentrale_2022_EN;29;1;;;;;;;;;;;DekaBank offers the savings banks the opportunity to set aside emission reduction certificates from climate prote c- tion projects previously verified by DekaBank via the Deka Easy Access (DEA) information and trading platform. More than 130 savings banks already use the DEA -CO 2 module.
310;DekaBank_Deutsche_Girozentrale_2022_EN;29;1;;;;;;;;;;;"For the savings banks, the extensive support from Deka- Bank has several advantages: On the one hand, the CO 2 compensation platform in DEA provides them with a func- tioning infrastructure and a reliable process; on the other hand, they save themselves extensive research into suita- ble compensation projects, as DekaBank takes care of this for them. The legal and administrative burden is also re- duced, as DekaBank has already negotiated a framework agreement with all project providers."

With regard to the sustainability of certificates, two levels must be considered in principle: Firstly, the issuer, DekaBank, and secondly – if available – the underlying asset, e.g. an index or an individual company.
351;DekaBank_Deutsche_Girozentrale_2022_EN;34;0;;;;;;;;;;;The consideration of the issuer is necessary because certificates are bea rer bonds of the issuer that serve it for refinancing. As a rule, the liquidity obtained through the issue of a certificate is used for the issuer's lending activities. In its lending activities, DekaBank takes into account the main adverse effects on sus- tainability factors and attempts to reduce them.
352;DekaBank_Deutsche_Girozentrale_2022_EN;34;1;;;;;;;;;;;"With regard to DekaBank's sustainability as an issuer, the sustainability rating agencies attest to the bank's very high level, even by sector standards. ( CF. CHAPTER 5.7. ) Sustainability criteria are also very important at the second level, i.e. the selection of underlying assets. For example, the companies selected for the issue of certificates must not be af- fected by the exclusion crit eria defined by DekaBank in its ""ESG product strategy certificates""."
353;DekaBank_Deutsche_Girozentrale_2022_EN;34;1;;;;;;;;;;;This document is pub- lished on the website www.deka.de/zertifikate/produkte/na- chhaltigkeit . With regard to indices that can serve as the basis for certifi- cates, DekaBank's focus in the year under review was on pro- moting transparency about the construction and implementa- tion of the ESG indices that the bank has launched in recent years t ogether with index provider MSCI.
354;DekaBank_Deutsche_Girozentrale_2022_EN;34;1;;;;;;;;;;;In this context, among other things, an explanatory film was produced for these ESG indices, web -based online training was offered to the savings banks and additional product training was carried out.

The green credits deposited with these ""fixed -interest/stepped -interest bonds Green Bond"" were reviewed for the first time in 2022 with regard to their taxonomy conformity."
356;DekaBank_Deutsche_Girozentrale_2022_EN;34;1;;;;;;;;;;;"In the year under review, DekaBank published an "" Impact & Allocation Reporting"". Among other things, this report pro- vides information on the use of funds from certificates issued under the Green Bond Framework and the resulting CO 2 sav- ings. With the Impact and Allocation Report, which must be updated ann ually, DekaBank meets the requirement for corre- sponding reporting. This was confirmed by the sustainability rating agency Sustainalytics."
357;DekaBank_Deutsche_Girozentrale_2022_EN;34;1;;;;;;;;;;;The framework and the second party opinion are published on the Deka website, as are the Impact and Allocation Report and the Annual Review. As of 31 December 2022, 58.9 percent of the outstanding cer- tificates for private customers have sustainability features (6,020 of 10,229 certificates). Of these, 37 certificates (fixed - interest/stepped -interest Green Bond) achieve a n impact refer- ence.

It formulates the goal of achieving climate neutrality by 2050.
434;DekaBank_Deutsche_Girozentrale_2022_EN;40;0;;;;;;;;;;;In order to live up to this claim, six concrete product -related goals were formulated in addition to overarching business goals: ■ Establishment and expansion of a sustainable product range ■ Reduction of the CO 2 footprint of the properties of the in- vestment funds ■ At the same time, the orienta tion towards corresponding decarbonisation paths of the EU ■ Expansion of green leases in the products ■ Increase in the certification rate of the fund properties ■ Exclusion of issuers in the fund.

437;DekaBank_Deutsche_Girozentrale_2022_EN;40;0;;;;;;;;;;;Sustainable real estate funds – development and expan- sion of the sustainable product range As part of the expansion of the sustainable product range, three more open -ended mutual funds were supplemented with their own ESG strategy in 2022, meaning that all open - ended mutual funds in the AMI business division and one spe- cial fund are now classified as Article 8 products in accordance with the Disclosure Regulation.
438;DekaBank_Deutsche_Girozentrale_2022_EN;40;0;;;;;;;;;;;The ESG strategy focuses on successively redu cing the CO 2 footprint of the properties man- aged in the funds. The targeted reduction is oriented towards a decarbonisation path that is compatible with the EU climate goals. An important component for reducing CO 2 emissions is increasing the energy effici ency of the properties.
439;DekaBank_Deutsche_Girozentrale_2022_EN;40;1;;;;;;;;;;;As part of the further development of the ESG strategies, con- sideration of the Principal Adverse Impacts (PAI) in accordance with Article 7 of the Disclosure Regulation was ensured for all relevant products in the year under revie w by integrating cor- responding criteria into the investment processes. In total, Deka Immobilien Investment GmbH managed around 36.6 billion euros (2021: 7.5 billion euros) as of 31 December 2022, explicitly taking sustainability criteria into account.

Like the sustainability filter for DekaBank's own investments, it is based on the principles of the UN Global Compact and also excludes arms companies from capital investm ent.
442;DekaBank_Deutsche_Girozentrale_2022_EN;40;1;;;;;;;;;;;Issuers that generate more than 10 percent of their sales from coal mining or more than 30 percent of their sales from coal -fired power generation are also excluded. As of 31 December 2022, around 5.6 billion euros (2021: 5.8 billion euros) were man- aged using this filter.

For example, the CO 2 emis- sions associated with the properties fell from 525,628 tonnes in 2020 to around 475,000 tonnes in 2021. ( CF. TABLE 5 ) Of these, approx. 331,000 tonnes were attributable to the mutual funds and approx. 144,000 tonnes to special funds. In relation to a square metre of space, 45.6 kg/m² of CO 2 was generated in the mutual funds (2020: 52.5 kg/m²) and 37.

All consumption data is requested from the asset managers of the properties via an online query and processed in a database. Together with experts from an energy consulting company, the suppl ies are subjected to comprehensive quality assurance and plausibility checks. Implausible data and data gaps are re- placed by suitable benchmark values.
448;DekaBank_Deutsche_Girozentrale_2022_EN;41;1;;;;;;;;;;;Since the consumption of the tenants is usually not known, it has to be extrapolated on the basis of the general electricity consumption. CO 2 emissions are calculated on the basis of energy consump- tion values and using appropriate conversion factors. Heating, cooling and general electricity consumption are taken into ac- count. Energies generated on site, e.g . from photovoltaic sys- tems, are not included in the calculation.
449;DekaBank_Deutsche_Girozentrale_2022_EN;41;1;;;;;;;;;;;The conversion of consumption into emissions is based on the customary CO 2 factors for the respective energy mix. The need for continuous improvement of data quality remains. To this end, w ork is being done in particular on a special data management system, which is expected to be ready for testing from Q1/2023.
450;DekaBank_Deutsche_Girozentrale_2022_EN;41;1;;;;;;;;;;;Decarbonisation path The business division's sustainability strategy stipulates that the reduction of CO 2 emissions in the propert y portfolio should be in line with the EU's climate targets, which in turn are derived from the Paris climate goals.
451;DekaBank_Deutsche_Girozentrale_2022_EN;41;1;;;;;;;;;;;Deka Immobilien Investment GmbH uses the Carbon Risk Real Estate Monitor (CRREM), which was developed by several universities as part of a re- search project, as a benchmark for the ongoing assessment of the funds' compliance with the EU's climate targets. Taking into account various variables, e.g.
452;DekaBank_Deutsche_Girozentrale_2022_EN;41;1;;;;;;;;;;;the type of use of a prop- erty and its location, the science -based tool provides infor- mation on t he maximum energy consumption and CO 2 emis- sions that should be achieved at certain points in time in order to meet the EU climate targets. The CRREM target paths are continuously adapted by the research project to current devel- opments and improved data bas es. At the end of the year un- der review, a total of 81.
453;DekaBank_Deutsche_Girozentrale_2022_EN;41;1;;;;;;;;;;;1 percent of the market values of the entire portfolio were below their respective object -specific CRREM path and thus in line with the EU's climate targets. Real estate management to improve energy efficiency and reduce CO 2 emissions The cooperation with the PropTech provider MeteoViva Cli- mate to optimise energy consumption and thus also reduce CO 2 emissions without any loss of comfort for the users was successfully continued in the reporting period.
454;DekaBank_Deutsche_Girozentrale_2022_EN;41;2;;;;;;;;;;;At the end of the year under review, a total of 66 properties from various funds were equipped with this technology, of which 30 facili- ties were commis sioned in 2022. In the year under review, about 30,000 MWh/a of electricity and thermal energy were saved in the properties equipped with this technology, which corresponds to a CO 2 saving of about 5,920 tonnes.
455;DekaBank_Deutsche_Girozentrale_2022_EN;41;2;;;;;;;;;;;"In 2022, the technology was installed for th e first time in a property in the USA and put into operation in two properties in the Czech Republic. In selected pilot projects in Germany, Austria, the UK and France, ""energy assessments"" were carried out by MeteoViva Climate to significantly reduce ene rgy demand for autumn and winter 2022 through targeted measures and in consultation with tenants."
456;DekaBank_Deutsche_Girozentrale_2022_EN;41;2;;;;;;;;;;;The results are promising overall, although they depend heavily on the specific external conditions at the indi- vidual locations. In order to be able to assess how high the heat saving poten- tial can be by lowering the room temperatures during times of use in non -residential buildings, simulation calculations were also carried out in a pilot property as part of a study.
457;DekaBank_Deutsche_Girozentrale_2022_EN;41;2;;;;;;;;;;;The re- sults of the study show that an energy saving of six to eleven percent can be achieved by lowering the room temperatures by one degree Celsius and thus a small sacrifice of comfort for.

Cur- rently, the purchase of 100 percent green electricity for the common areas and technology of the majority of Ge rman properties in the Deka Immobilien Investment GmbH’s portfo- lio saves more than 30,000 tonnes of CO 2 per year.
460;DekaBank_Deutsche_Girozentrale_2022_EN;42;0;;;;;;;;;;;Since 1 January 2020, the switch to green gas will save an additional 9,500 tonnes of CO 2 per year. Green Leases To ensure the climate and e nvironmental quality of the prop- erty portfolio in the long term, Deka Immobilien Investment GmbH sees the broad application of green leases as an integral part of its asset management activities. To this end, green model clauses have been formulated for th e German leases, which are generally addressed in new leases and other lease negotiations.
461;DekaBank_Deutsche_Girozentrale_2022_EN;42;0;;;;;;;;;;;Currently, around ten percent of all relevant ten- ancy agreements contain such clauses. Further information on the contents of green leases can be found at www.deka.d e/immobilien_en/sustainability/insight -into-prac- tice/green -lease -en. External certifications and ratings The sustainability -related certification of fund properties has been an important element of the sustainability strategy in the AMI business division since 2010.
462;DekaBank_Deutsche_Girozentrale_2022_EN;42;0;;;;;;;;;;;In the case of external certifi- cation by a qualified service provider, the properties are in- spected and evaluated from social, ecological and economic points of view over the entire life cycle. At the end of the year under review, a total of 364 properties (2021: 313) worth around 39.1 billion euros (2021: 34.7 bil- lion euros) were certified.
463;DekaBank_Deutsche_Girozentrale_2022_EN;42;0;;;;;;;;;;;In relation to the total property as- sets of the Deka funds, a certification rate of around 79 per- cent (2021: 74 percent) was achieved at the end of 2022.

Sustainability in lending For the Deka Group, ESG aspects rank alongside economic as- pects when granting loans in the sense of holistic and risk -op- timised portfolio management and are examined before the lending decision is made.
464;DekaBank_Deutsche_Girozentrale_2022_EN;42;1;;;;;;;;;;;The Deka Group's lending business comprises trading and capital market transactions, property fi- nance and special finance. To take account of ES G criteria as defined in the Guidelines on Loan Origination and Monitoring of the European Banking Authority (EBA), ESG scorecards have been developed for all segments of lending business and have been an inherent part of the lending process since July 202 1.
465;DekaBank_Deutsche_Girozentrale_2022_EN;42;1;;;;;;;;;;;They are used to assess the risks associated with ESG factors of both the borrower and the specific financing for each limit es- tablishment, increase and prolongation. The ESG scorecards consider physical and transitory climate risks, labour and hu- man ri ghts criteria and governance aspects on a segment -spe- cific basis. The assessment is based on an ESG traffic light logic with a classification of the financing or the borrower with low to high ESG risks.
466;DekaBank_Deutsche_Girozentrale_2022_EN;42;1;;;;;;;;;;;A high risk classification generally leads to rejecti on of the transaction.

They have access to a wide range of measures that are continuously developed in line with strategy and needs. It in- cludes offers for the development of personal, methodologic al, social and professional skills.
573;DekaBank_Deutsche_Girozentrale_2022_EN;52;0;;;;;;;;;;;"DekaBank supports its employees with internal or external training measures, both financially and in terms of time. The form and scope of employee involve- ment in jointly determining their professional development is based on the internal ""skills development"" agreement."
574;DekaBank_Deutsche_Girozentrale_2022_EN;52;0;;;;;;;;;;;"The agreed training takes place either as part of professional activities, for example by taking on project tasks, or through measures that are carried out ""off the job"", such as seminars or longer -term tr aining courses that are completed with a cer- tificate. DekaBank is also increasingly relying on short and digi- tal formats as part of its training offering in order to enable good integration and application in everyday working life as well as mobile access."
575;DekaBank_Deutsche_Girozentrale_2022_EN;52;0;;;;;;;;;;;In particular, opportunities for virtual participation in online courses and self -learning formats have been expanded. In addition to location -independent access to learning opportunities, the aim is also to promote and support competences in the use of d igital tools and media, for example in the context of the MS Teams rollout. Examples of this are virtual presence training, e -learning or corresponding blended learning offers, i.e. the combination of different methods and media.
576;DekaBank_Deutsche_Girozentrale_2022_EN;52;0;;;;;;;;;;;For example, online face -to-face training and e -learning are enriched with transfer -supporting tasks between smaller learning units. This is intended to promote competence devel- opment with appropriate practical relevance. The DekaLearning learning system maps the internal central further education offering. It provides employees with a com- prehensive overview of the further training on offer and thus enables them to put together personal learning plans.
577;DekaBank_Deutsche_Girozentrale_2022_EN;52;1;;;;;;;;;;;Here, users can opt for self -learning or guided learning formats ac- cording to their individual learning preferences. Further training expenditure In the year under review, the financial expenditure for further training measures amounted to an average of 998 euros per employee capacity in Ger many (2021: 865 euros).
578;DekaBank_Deutsche_Girozentrale_2022_EN;52;1;;;;;;;;;;;In order to do justice to the changed framework conditions surrounding mobile working, the further training offering continues to rely increasingly on shorter and digital formats, as described above. The provision of short and digit al trainings not only leads to a higher use of the offers, but also has an impact on the average investment in further trainings per employee. The above figure does not include expenses for further training within the scope of various projects, e.g.
579;DekaBank_Deutsche_Girozentrale_2022_EN;52;1;;;;;;;;;;;"for th e implementation of MIFID II and the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR; DS -GVO), measures ""on the job"" and the use of educational leave. A total of 20,999 seminar hours (2021: 36,859) were com- pleted as part of the DekaLearning offerings in the year under review. On average, 5.6 hours (2021: 9.9) per employee ca- pacity were invested in DekaLearning events."
580;DekaBank_Deutsche_Girozentrale_2022_EN;52;1;;;;;;;;;;;The decline in seminar hours per employee capacity is due to the fact that numerous IT training courses were held in 2021, for example on the use o f web -based video conferencing, the importance of which has increased significantly in the wake of the Corona pandemic. In 2020, the corresponding value was 4.4 hours per employee capacity. External training is not included in the mentioned figures. ( CF.

Already in 202 0, the surveys were adapted to the requirements of the increased implementation of virtual learning formats in order to ensure the recording of support needs, perception of benefits and transfer possibilities and to take them into account in the learning o ffers of the year under review.

Strategy and governance The diversity of the workforce is an enrichment for the Deka Group, as each and every individual brings individual strengths and perspectives to the company. Diversity of perspective is a key success factor for the company's competitiveness and fu- ture viability.
585;DekaBank_Deutsche_Girozentrale_2022_EN;53;0;;;;;;;;;;;The basis for this is the acti ve promotion of an open, appreciative and inclusive corporate culture. This applies to the dimensions of gender, age structure and generation mix, cultural background, religion, disability, social origin and sexual orientation. ( CF. FIGURE 6 ) As part of the business strategy, this understanding is a long -term commitment by the Deka Group to diversity and equal opportunities in the com- pany.

The focus here is initially on increasing the representation of women in management, specialist career and project manage- ment positions, as well as on establishing a balanced age structure and a sustainable generation mix. To pursue these goals, the instruments of human resources management are being further developed.
587;DekaBank_Deutsche_Girozentrale_2022_EN;53;0;;;;;;;;;;;These included anchoring openness to diversity in the HR competency model as the basis for all hu- man resources measures and promoting diversity aspects through executive counselling as well as in application, talent and succession management.

Feedback and support The Deka Group attaches great importance to a continuous exchange with employees in order to be able to take their as- sessments into account when designing and implementing measures. In 2022, for example, feedback was collected on the topic of diversity, among other things, as part of the Puls - Check employee survey. In the survey, 68 percent of partici- pants stated that they felt that the Deka Group offers equal opportunities. ( CF. C HAPTER 2.3.1.
611;DekaBank_Deutsche_Girozentrale_2022_EN;56;2;;;;;;;;;;;) A survey was also con- ducted on work -life balance. Numerous measures were initiated in the year under review to support the Deka Group's approach to cultural diversity in the future. As a basis for the development and implementation of the measures, existing strengths and weaknesses in dealing with the iss ue of diversity were identified using the focus group tool. To provide targeted information, the equal opportunities offic- ers offer events aimed specifically at women.
612;DekaBank_Deutsche_Girozentrale_2022_EN;56;2;;;;;;;;;;;"These include the annual women's meeting, which is regularly attended by a member of t he Deka Group's Board of Management, and the DekaFrauenFokus series of events focusing on topics such as ""Strengthening cooperation and increasing impact"". In addi- tion, two women's networks founded by female employees and female managers in the Deka Group again promoted in- ternal networking within the company during this year under review."
613;DekaBank_Deutsche_Girozentrale_2022_EN;56;2;;;;;;;;;;;The external networking of women in the German -speaking investment fund industry is the mission of the career network Fondsfrauen, which DekaBank joined in 2018. Since 20 20, DekaBank has also been a member of IWIL (Initiative Women Into Leadership), a cross -company mentoring programme for women in senior management positions.
614;DekaBank_Deutsche_Girozentrale_2022_EN;56;3;;;;;;;;;;;To support people with limited physical or mental abilities, the Deka Group actively promotes a culture that builds trust, as in- visible disabilities may often be concealed for fear of prejudice or discrimination. To this end, for example, an information campaign was initiated in the year under review to counter prejudice against people with a disability.
615;DekaBank_Deutsche_Girozentrale_2022_EN;56;3;;;;;;;;;;;In order to provide employees with physical disabilities with a good working and development atmosphere, the Deka Group has designed the offices accordin gly: All buildings are accessi- ble without barriers and, where necessary, have sliding doors or doors with electronic door openers. The work equipment provided by the Deka Group is generally of a higher standard than required by law.
616;DekaBank_Deutsche_Girozentrale_2022_EN;56;3;;;;;;;;;;;"In addition to the repr esentatives for the severely disabled in the Deka Group, the Employee Assistance Programme (EAP) is another point of contact from which disa- bled employees also receive effective support. 4.2.4.4.

In order to increase the at- tractiveness of these training offers, a demand -based align- ment of the diversity seminars for the followin g year was car- ried out in the year under review 2022.

This applies in particular to employees with children or relatives in need of ca re. All employees have access to counselling and mediation services on the topics of child- care and nursing care, regardless of location.
619;DekaBank_Deutsche_Girozentrale_2022_EN;56;4;;;;;;;;;;;In addition to the counselling services, the equal opportunities officer offers events on the topic of care as well as meetings for parents for all employees.

621;DekaBank_Deutsche_Girozentrale_2022_EN;57;0;;;;;;;;;;;In the year under review, there was also a focus on supporting managers in their task of developing good and coordinated work -life balance solutions for their teams and all team mem- bers. The central Strategy & HR department also conducted a survey on the concrete need for childcare close to the work- place at the German locations in order to derive measures from this if necessary and possible in the coming year. These measures also enable divers e life models in the workforce. 4.2.5.1.
622;DekaBank_Deutsche_Girozentrale_2022_EN;57;0;;;;;;;;;;;Support for employees with children Permanent employees with younger children can take ad- vantage of the Deka Group's childcare support. The offer in- cludes 30 crèche places and 22 nursery places, which are pro- vided at the Fra nkfurt site. Due to the high demand for nursery places, the number of nursery places was increased from 17 to 22 places in the year under review.
623;DekaBank_Deutsche_Girozentrale_2022_EN;57;0;;;;;;;;;;;Since 2018, it has also been possible for employees, who work for the Deka Group outside the head office in Fr ankfurt to apply for a childcare place at a pme Familienservice location throughout Germany, depending on availability. In addition, the Deka Group offers emergency childcare, which parents can use free of charge for up to five days per year per child if regular childcare is cancelled.
624;DekaBank_Deutsche_Girozentrale_2022_EN;57;0;;;;;;;;;;;Parents of school -age children are also supported in bridging the time off school by funding up to ten days of holiday programme per year and child. On average, Deka Group employees have returned to work 12.8 months (2021: 13.3 months) after the birth of a child over the past five years. Employees took parental leave at the same level as in the previous year. During 2022, 106 male em- ployees (2021: 106) of the Deka Group took parental leave.
625;DekaBank_Deutsche_Girozentrale_2022_EN;57;1;;;;;;;;;;;Although their number was higher than that of women (64) (2021: 84), the average duration of parental leave taken was shorter (men: 1.6 months / women: 11.7 months). The return rate after parental leave was 98.8 percent (2021: 95.1 per- cent), while the retention rate was 95.1 percent in th e year un- der review (2021: 96.8 percent). ( CF.

Since 2015, the Deka Group has also been cooperating with Viva Familienservice, which offers advice and mediation on al l aspects of childcare and nursing care. In the year under review, 64 cases were processed in the Work & Children category (2021: 66).
627;DekaBank_Deutsche_Girozentrale_2022_EN;57;1;;;;;;;;;;;Since employees can place their requests by phone or email, the service is available across all locations in Ger- many. Thi s means that employees in Luxembourg can also par- ticipate if their question relates to Germany. 4.2.5.2. Support for employees with dependants in need of care To underline the importance of this issue, the Deka Group signed the Charter for Reconciling Work and Care in Hesse in 2014.
628;DekaBank_Deutsche_Girozentrale_2022_EN;57;1;;;;;;;;;;;With its measures, the Deka Group wants to help create a working environment in which caring for family members is not a taboo subject and those affected are shown respect and recognition for this task. In cooperation with professional partners such as Viva Fami- lienservice, employees who care for relatives in need of care, are supported. The so -called eldercare counselling and media- tion relieves employees in the organisation, financing and im- plementation of care tasks.
629;DekaBank_Deutsche_Girozentrale_2022_EN;57;2;;;;;;;;;;;In the year under review, 256 cases (2021: 152) were handled by Viva Familienservice in this area.

In an agreement concluded with the staff council and the works council s, it was determined that mobile working is increasingly possible for all employees within the framework of opera- tional, legal and regulatory requirements.
636;DekaBank_Deutsche_Girozentrale_2022_EN;58;2;;;;;;;;;;;"Within the frame- work of the corresponding service or works agreements, em- ployees are generally given the right to work 40 percent of their working hours on a mobile basis.

There are defined exceptions for individ- ual areas and functions; in the e vent of disagreement between the parties involved, a regulated arbitration procedure takes effect."
637;DekaBank_Deutsche_Girozentrale_2022_EN;58;2;;;;;;;;;;;In addition, there are accompanying regulations on technical equipment, insurance and data protection.

Measures of protection during the Corona pandemic The Corona pandemic, which continues into 2022, has presented occupational health and safety with a number of challenges.
665;DekaBank_Deutsche_Girozentrale_2022_EN;61;1;;;;;;;;;;;In order to protect the workforce from the virus and minimise the risk of infection, numerous coun- termeasures were taken, in particular the expansion of the possibility for mobile working and the implementation of the SARS -CoV-2 occupational health and safety standards required by the Federal Ministry of Labour and Social Af- fairs (Bundesministerium für Arbeit und Soziales, BMAS) at all sites.
666;DekaBank_Deutsche_Girozentrale_2022_EN;61;1;;;;;;;;;;;"These were continuously adapted to the updated requirements in cooperation with several organisational units for the German sites. The upda tes were also re- viewed by the company doctor on duty and the occupa- tional safety specialist as part of a renewed ""Corona risk assessment"". Part of the concept was and is the compre- hensive information of the workforce, e.g."
667;DekaBank_Deutsche_Girozentrale_2022_EN;61;1;;;;;;;;;;;"via ""Corona FAQs"" published on th e Intranet, as well as the provision of employees with hygiene tools such as rapid tests and FFP2 masks. In addition, the Deka Group offered booster vaccinations with the company doctors of the CCB Cardioangiolo- gisches Centrum Bethanien in December 2021 and Janu- ary 2022. Around 1,000 employees and their relatives and external employees took advantage of this opportunity."
668;DekaBank_Deutsche_Girozentrale_2022_EN;61;1;;;;;;;;;;;As there is no general recommendation for a 2nd booster vaccination for persons under 60 years of age so far, no further vaccination offer could be made at the end of 2022. However, as soon as the recommendation by the Standing Vaccination Com mittee at the Robert Koch Insti- tute (Ständige Impfkommission, STIKO) is adjusted, em- ployees can be offered a vaccination.
669;DekaBank_Deutsche_Girozentrale_2022_EN;61;1;;;;;;;;;;;A corresponding agreement has already been made with the long -standing occupational health service provider Medical Airport Ser- vice Gm bH.

Mental health In 2022, the Deka Group continued to conduct surveys in vari- ous areas of the company in order to systematically evaluate mental stress in the workplace and develop needs -based offer- ings.
671;DekaBank_Deutsche_Girozentrale_2022_EN;62;0;;;;;;;;;;;"As part of its training programme, the Deka Grou p offers employees and managers numerous seminars on how to deal with stressful situations, such as the online training course ""Self -leadership and resilience in hybrid forms of work"". The training programme for all employees includes the seminars ""Life ba lance/resilience"" and ""Managing personal resources, coping with stress, maintaining performance""."
672;DekaBank_Deutsche_Girozentrale_2022_EN;62;0;;;;;;;;;;;To take account of the specific demands of the group man- agement function, the Deka Group piloted a new health ser- vice for this target group in the year under review. The digital health coaching service covers the main topics of bowel cancer screening, blood tests, medical history and medical coaching sessions. Questionnaires on the main topics of medicine, exer- cise, nutrition and mental health can be used to i dentify and discuss specific needs for action.
673;DekaBank_Deutsche_Girozentrale_2022_EN;62;0;;;;;;;;;;;Changes in health -related stresses can be reflected on in a time -delayed re -coaching ses- sion. All employees and their relatives, who find themselves in a psy- chological crisis situation can receive concrete s upport from ex- ternal experts from the professional counselling service INSITE Interventions. As part of the Employee Assistance Programme (EAP), Deka Group employees have the option of receiving counselling anonymously if they wish.
674;DekaBank_Deutsche_Girozentrale_2022_EN;62;0;;;;;;;;;;;The EAP also offers an expert service for managers, management advisers and mem- bers of the staff council or works council, as well as the equal opportunities representative and the representative for the se- verely disabled. Especially in the case of serious illnesses, psy- chologic al support can be provided through the counselling service and a second or third opinion can be obtained through medical experts.
675;DekaBank_Deutsche_Girozentrale_2022_EN;62;0;;;;;;;;;;;In addition, INSITE tries to arrange appoint- ments with specialists without long waiting times. In the year under review, the INSITE experts again held numer- ous counselling sessions with employees. Overall, around 9.5 percent of employees made use of this service in 2022 (2021: 7.1 percent). The utilisation rate is thus slightly above the pre- vious year's level. This value is evi dence of a high level of awareness and shows that the counselling service is well estab- lished in the company.
676;DekaBank_Deutsche_Girozentrale_2022_EN;62;1;;;;;;;;;;;In the year under review, a number of digital events were organised to support employees in line with the current situation. As part of occupatio nal integration management (betriebliche s Eingliederungsmanagement, BEM), DekaBank provides support to employees returning to work after a prolonged or recurring illness. In a personal discussion, which is voluntary for those af- fected, measures are identif ied that can help to overcome the illness and prevent renewed incapacity to work.
677;DekaBank_Deutsche_Girozentrale_2022_EN;62;1;;;;;;;;;;;A service and company agreement was successfully negotiated and con- cluded with the employee representatives. 4.2.7. Remuneration The Deka Group's remuneration sy stem is based on the long - term corporate strategy and takes into account the relevant regulatory requirements. It is reviewed annually to ensure that it complies with regulations and, if necessary, adjusted to re- flect the current regulatory requirements.
678;DekaBank_Deutsche_Girozentrale_2022_EN;62;1;;;;;;;;;;;The remuneration of employees is based exclusively on func- tion and performance and generally includes fixed and variable remuneration elements. Regular market comparisons ensure that remuneration is attractive and in line with the market. When granting ben efits, the Deka Group generally does not differentiate between part -time and full -time employees. The remuneration of permanent employees is based on their qualifications and tasks and is granted on a gender -neutral ba- sis.
679;DekaBank_Deutsche_Girozentrale_2022_EN;62;1;;;;;;;;;;;In the pay scale area, remunerat ion is currently at least ac- cording to pay scale group 4 of the collective agreement for the private banking industry and public banks and ends ac- cordingly with pay scale group 9. The remuneration of employ- ees paid outside the pay scale is above pay scale group 9. The annual starting salary outside the pay scale is 10.4 percent above the salary of pay scale group 9 with eleven years of pro- fessional experience converted to twelve monthly salaries.
680;DekaBank_Deutsche_Girozentrale_2022_EN;62;1;;;;;;;;;;;The proportion of employees receiving non -tariff pay has incr eased to 69 percent in 2022 (2021: 68 percent). (CF. TABLE 24a + 24b) Excellent health management In order to review and further de velop its varied and high - quality health management offerings, the Deka Group once again underwent a comprehensive audit in the year under review as part of the Corporate Health Awards, which was carried out by EUPD Research and Handels - blatt.

DekaBank's overriding objective is to grant all employees fair and non -discriminatory remuneration. DekaBank therefore supports the objectives of the Act to Promote the Transpar- ency of Remuneration Structures (Entgelttransparenzgesetz).
685;DekaBank_Deutsche_Girozentrale_2022_EN;63;1;;;;;;;;;;;The Act improves the transparency of remuneration structures and thus aims to ensure the requirement of equal pay for women and men for the same work or work of equal value in practice. Based on this law, DekaBank informs its employees about what they earn compared to the peer group remunera- tion of the opposite sex. The principle and objective of gender -neutral remuneration at DekaBank has also been reflected in the principles for deter- mining salaries for many years.
686;DekaBank_Deutsche_Girozentrale_2022_EN;63;2;;;;;;;;;;;Salary determination and deci- sions on salary measures are based on several criteria: orienta- tion towards internal remuneration levels, comparison with ex- ternal market data and compliance with regulatory require- ments. All of these criteria are gender -neutral. The variable remuneration is granted on the basis of perfor- mance. Both the performance of the individual employee and the success of the Deka Group are taken into account.
687;DekaBank_Deutsche_Girozentrale_2022_EN;63;2;;;;;;;;;;;"An in- tegral part of the performance assessment of employees is the evaluation of compliance with the rules of conduct defined in the Deka Group's Code of Ethics. For employees, whose activities have a significant influence on the Deka Group's ov erall risk profile – so-called ""risk -relevant employees"" – part of the variable remuneration is subject to a multi -year assessment basis and a risk - or performance -based payment system, i.e. deferrals, in accordance with regulatory requirements."
688;DekaBank_Deutsche_Girozentrale_2022_EN;63;2;;;;;;;;;;;In accord ance with the regulatory requirements for institutions and other subsidiaries of the Deka Group, variable remunera- tion may be granted up to a maximum of 100 percent of the fixed remuneration. In accordance with Section 25a (5) of the German Banking Act (Kr editwesengesetz, KWG), this upper limit for variable remuneration may be increased to 200 per- cent of the fixed remuneration by resolution of the sharehold- ers.
689;DekaBank_Deutsche_Girozentrale_2022_EN;63;2;;;;;;;;;;;In the year under review, DekaBank did not make use of an increased upper limit for variable remu neration for mem- bers of the Board of Management or any other employees of the DekaBank. The Deka Group's remuneration system encourages adequate risk-taking behaviour and sanctions misconduct. Particularly relevant to the Deka Group's risk culture are tho se parts of re- muneration that create incentives to take or avoid financial risks, such as bonus payments.
690;DekaBank_Deutsche_Girozentrale_2022_EN;63;2;;;;;;;;;;;With regard to the risk culture, the Deka Group aligns its remuneration policy so that it is in line with the risk profile of the institution or the D eka Group. The Board of Management and the management of the sub- sidiaries are responsible for, approve and monitor the remu- neration policy.
691;DekaBank_Deutsche_Girozentrale_2022_EN;63;2;;;;;;;;;;;The Board of Management, the management of the subsidiaries and senior management ensure that the Deka Group's remun eration system promotes ethical conduct and compliance with the law, regulation and internal guide- lines. In addition, the variable remuneration is dependent on risk-adjusted key figures.
692;DekaBank_Deutsche_Girozentrale_2022_EN;64;0;;;;;;;;;;; Table of contents 64 Employees Sustainable human resources management S – SOCIAL The remuneration policy is also designed to support the achievement of strategic business objectives, taking into ac- count sustainability aspects, and to promote incentives for re- sponsible and risk -conscious business conduct among employ- ees.
693;DekaBank_Deutsche_Girozentrale_2022_EN;64;0;;;;;;;;;;;The effectivene ss and appropriateness of the remunera- tion systems in the Deka Group are managed or monitored by appropriate bodies and functions, such as the Administrative Board's Remuneration Control Committee, the Deka Group re- muneration officer and the Deka Group Rem uneration Com- mittee. Fixed and variable remuneration are in an appropriate relationship to each other.
694;DekaBank_Deutsche_Girozentrale_2022_EN;64;0;;;;;;;;;;;This is the case when, on the one hand, there is no significant dependence on the variable remu- neration or negative incentives to take on disproportionat ely high risk positions are avoided and, on the other hand, the variable remuneration can provide an effective incentive for behaviour.
695;DekaBank_Deutsche_Girozentrale_2022_EN;64;0;;;;;;;;;;;The Deka Group's current risk situation is taken into account at various points in the remuneration process, such as th e bo- nus pool calculation, compliance with the rules of conduct, the identification of risk -relevant employees and the remuneration parameters of the control units. In addition to the employer benefits regulated in the collective wage agreement, the Deka Group offers, among other things, capital -forming benefits and group and business travel accident insurance.
696;DekaBank_Deutsche_Girozentrale_2022_EN;64;0;;;;;;;;;;;Permanent employees receive a largely employer -funded company pen- sion scheme (BVV). Details of pension obligations can be found in the consolidated f inancial statements. The remuneration system for members of the Board of Man- agement of DekaBank generally complies with the remunera- tion principles for employees of the Deka Group and also takes into account the special regulatory requirements applicable to risk-relevant employees.
697;DekaBank_Deutsche_Girozentrale_2022_EN;64;0;;;;;;;;;;;The aim of the Board of Management remuneration system is to comply with regulatory require- ments, including ESG criteria, as well as the principles of man- agement remuneration of the Wittenberg Centre for Global Ethics.

For example, sustain- ability is a component of the Deka Gr oup's Code of Ethics, which was expanded and sharpened during the reporting period to include ESG criteria. (CF. CHAPTER 2.2.1.
699;DekaBank_Deutsche_Girozentrale_2022_EN;64;1;;;;;;;;;;;) This is the basis for the assessment of good conduct, which is taken into account in the annual performance evaluation and cons equently in the variable remuneration. The same applies to the efficient and sparing use of resources. As- pects relevant to sustainability are anchored in the sales area on a selective basis, for example in the form of sales targets for sustainable investme nt products.
700;DekaBank_Deutsche_Girozentrale_2022_EN;64;1;;;;;;;;;;;In 2021, there was a need for further action to integrate sustainability aspects into remuneration on the basis of the Disclosure Regulation and the requirements of the Eu- ropean Central Bank's (ECB) guidelines on dealing with cli- mate and envir onmental risks. Section 5 of the Disclosure Regulation explicitly requires transparency of the remuner- ation policy in connection with the consideration of sus- tainability risks.
701;DekaBank_Deutsche_Girozentrale_2022_EN;64;1;;;;;;;;;;;DekaBank is implementing the corre- sponding requirements as part of a two -stage process. In a first step, the existing sustainability elements within the remuneration system were strengthened and managers were specifically made aware of the need to take these el- ements into account. In a second step, climate and envi- ronmental risks wer e given greater consideration when determining the bonus pool.
702;DekaBank_Deutsche_Girozentrale_2022_EN;64;1;;;;;;;;;;;In addition, key figures for climate and environmental risks are to be concretised and remuneration practices to promote the achievement of targets are to be derived from them.

The central aim is to ensure that their diverse offerings are open to society. The partnerships are designed to be lo ng-term and are characterised by intensive cooperation and an exchange based on trust. DekaBank fo- cuses on the following areas: 1.
707;DekaBank_Deutsche_Girozentrale_2022_EN;65;0;;;;;;;;;;;In the area of education and science, the Deka Group aims to link science and practice by supporting academic institu- tions and endowed chairs, thereby facilitating a productive exchange of knowledge. One example of this is IQAM Re- search, the private institute for quantitative capital market research.
708;DekaBank_Deutsche_Girozentrale_2022_EN;65;0;;;;;;;;;;;The collaborations enable DekaBank to set practi- cal research priorities and thus provide impetus for the fur- ther anchoring of relevant topics in the financial market, particularly those related to sustainability. In addition, DekaBank can present itself as an attractive employer through contact with academics and students and attrac t qualified junior staff. 2.
709;DekaBank_Deutsche_Girozentrale_2022_EN;65;1;;;;;;;;;;;In the area of art, music and architecture, DekaBank pro- motes a diverse range of offerings and thus enables visitors to exhibitions and concerts at various levels to actively en- gage with very different cultural developments that s hape society. The programme is also explicitly aimed at employ- ees, who are often given special opportunities to take part in cultural activities.
710;DekaBank_Deutsche_Girozentrale_2022_EN;65;1;;;;;;;;;;;With the International Highrise Award (Internationaler Hochhauspreis, IHP), DekaBank provides impetus for sust ainable building in the future. 3.In the social sector, DekaBank's support enables coopera- tion partners to offer their services to economically and so- cially disadvantaged groups of the population, particularly children and young people, on a permanent basis, therebyimproving their living and educational opportunities and enabling them to participate in society.
711;DekaBank_Deutsche_Girozentrale_2022_EN;65;1;;;;;;;;;;;"DekaBank is cur- rently focusing its commitment in this area on supporting the Freundeskreis der Arche Frankfurt am Main. Social projects are also a fo cus of the two campaigns ""Deka – Engagiert vor Ort!"" [Deka – Making a local com- mitment] and ""Restcent"". They involve the Deka Group's employees extensively or are even largely supported by their commitment. As a result, in addition to the social pur- pose, t he loyalty and motivation of the workforce are also of great importance."
712;DekaBank_Deutsche_Girozentrale_2022_EN;65;1;;;;;;;;;;;"Because ""Deka – Engagiert vor Ort!"" often supports organisations, in which employees them- selves are involved, the campaign also reflects DekaBank's appreciation of the voluntary work of its employees. 4.More than almost any other area of society, sport stands for social integration."

Focal points of the year under review Social The ongoing Corona pandemic and the manifold effects of the Russian war of aggres sion on Ukraine had a direct impact on Die Arche – Kinderstiftung Christliches Kinder - und Jugend- werk e. V. in the year under review. Significant price increases, especially for food, put many families under considerable pres- sure.
717;DekaBank_Deutsche_Girozentrale_2022_EN;66;0;;;;;;;;;;;The need for food aid as well as free meals for needy children and their families has increased enormously. In addition to its support for the Freundeskreis der Arche Frankfurt am Main e. V., which has been in place since 2008, DekaBank therefore decided to donate 250,000 euros t o the Arche in the year under review to cover the additional food re- quirements for the 29 Arche Kinderstiftung facilities in Ger- many for the winter half -year and to offset food price in- creases.
718;DekaBank_Deutsche_Girozentrale_2022_EN;66;0;;;;;;;;;;;Architecture In 2022, the International Highrise Award (Internationaler Hochhauspreis, IHP) for the world's most innovative building was awarded for the tenth time. A total of 34 projects were nominated for the IHP 2022/23. A jury of experts chose the Quay Quarter Tower office building in Sydney by the architec- tural firm 3XN from Copenhagen as the winner.
719;DekaBank_Deutsche_Girozentrale_2022_EN;66;0;;;;;;;;;;;The tower convinced the jury as an innovative solution for sustai nable building in a time of increased ecological challenges: A large part of the shell of the existing high -rise from the 1970s was not demolished but integrated into the new building. Accord- ing to the jury, the high -rise is characterised by an unusual combination of upcycling and redensification.
720;DekaBank_Deutsche_Girozentrale_2022_EN;66;0;;;;;;;;;;;The IHP is awarded to buildings that distinguish themselves through excellence in aesthetics, forward -looking design, ur- ban integration as well as innovative technology, economic ef- ficiency, marketability and a sustainable construction method. An international jury of experts decides on the award. The IHP is awarded every two years in a ceremony in Frankfurt's Paul- skirche. The award is endowed with 50,000 euros and a statu- ette by the internationally renowned arti st Thomas Demand.
721;DekaBank_Deutsche_Girozentrale_2022_EN;66;1;;;;;;;;;;;On the occasion of the tenth anniversary of the award, Thomas Demand has designed a new version of the tower. The prize money is donated by the winners to promote young talent in the field of architecture and urban planning. The IHP is the world's most important architecture prize for high-rise buildings. It was initiated in 2003 by the City of Frankfurt, the German Museum of Architecture (Deutschen Ar- chitekturmuseum, DAM) and DekaBank.
722;DekaBank_Deutsche_Girozentrale_2022_EN;66;1;;;;;;;;;;;In recent years, it has succeeded in bringing the i mportance of high -rise architecture to the public's attention. Art The new corporate location of the Deka Group in Frankfurt Niederrad was furnished with artworks from the Deka Art Col- lection according to conceptual criteria: Three installations by Danie l Canogar, Zilla Leutenegger and Stefan Wieland geared to the location were realised for the public areas of Lyoner Strasse 13.
723;DekaBank_Deutsche_Girozentrale_2022_EN;66;1;;;;;;;;;;;In addition, around 240 works from the Deka Art Collection are presented on the conference floor. The art is communicated throug h guided tours, digital formats and new print formats. The Deka Art Collection has been built up since 2003 and comprises around 1,600 works by more than 450 artists from all over the world. It shows contemporary art in its media di- versity: painting, dra wing, photography, video, sculpture, in- stallation and digital art.
724;DekaBank_Deutsche_Girozentrale_2022_EN;66;1;;;;;;;;;;;The art collection is currently on dis- play for employees and guests in the Trianon high -rise and in Deka Group's new building in Frankfurt Niederrad. Music The Federal Youth Orchestra (Bun desjugendorchester), which DekaBank has been sponsoring since 2018, was the inspiration behind the establishment of a national youth symphony or- chestra in Ukraine in 2016.
725;DekaBank_Deutsche_Girozentrale_2022_EN;66;1;;;;;;;;;;;On the occasion of the war in Ukraine, the Federal Youth Orchestra initiated a relie f and fundraising campaign for the Youth Symphony Orchestra of Ukraine, in which DekaBank also participated with a donation. In addition, benefit concerts were held in the year under re- view, including one at Schloss Neuhardenberg, which is run by the Stift ung Schloss Neuhardenberg, a subsidiary of the Ger- man Savings Banks Association (DSGV).

For example, it donated 300,000 euros to the Aktionsbündnis Katastrophenhilfe (Action Alliance for Dis- aster Relief), which includes the German Caritas Associa- tion, the German Red Cross and the Protestant Associa- tion for Diakonie and Development.
727;DekaBank_Deutsche_Girozentrale_2022_EN;66;1;;;;;;;;;;;"100,000 euros went to the SOS Children's Villages for their work in Ukraine.

Here, employees were able to suggest associations from their personal envi- ronment that had organised aid campaigns for people in and from Ukraine. The selected projects were supported with an amount of 1,000 euros each."

Sustainable corporat e governance The requirements for sustainabl e corporate govern ance result both from mandatory regulator y require- ment s and from voluntary commitment s entered into by the D eka Group or individual subsidiaries.
744;DekaBank_Deutsche_Girozentrale_2022_EN;70;0;;;;;;;;;;;In par- ticular, there have been a large number of new regulatory requirements at E uropean and national level over the past few years, whi ch are intended to promote the embedding of sustainabilit y aspect s in banks and increase and standardi se transparenc y regarding the relevant measures. Through target ed structures and comprehensive processes, the De ka Group ensures that all regulator y requirements are met compre- hensivel y and on time.
745;DekaBank_Deutsche_Girozentrale_2022_EN;70;0;;;;;;;;;;;As the implementation of th e requirements also depend s in particular on the indi- vidual employees, their ongoing information and training i s an important component of th e correspond- ing measures. 5.1. Regulations and standards 5.1.1.
746;DekaBank_Deutsche_Girozentrale_2022_EN;70;0;;;;;;;;;;;Code of Ethics The Deka Group's Code of Ethics serves as a binding orienta- tion framework for the ethically and morally correct conduct and actions of employees, managers, members of the Board of Management and third parties acting on behalf of the Deka Group. The current version of the Code of Ethics is available on the Deka Group's website.
747;DekaBank_Deutsche_Girozentrale_2022_EN;70;0;;;;;;;;;;;"The preamble of the Code of Ethics sti pulates that a joint re- view between the manager and the employees is carried out within the framework of the appraisal interview to determine whether conduct is in line with the Code of Ethics. For this purpose, the module ""Assessment of good conduct accor ding to the Code of Ethics"" was integrated into the annual perfor- mance evaluation, which in turn flows into the calculation of the variable remuneration."
748;DekaBank_Deutsche_Girozentrale_2022_EN;70;0;;;;;;;;;;;Particularly serious violations of the Code of Ethics can lead to measures under labour law, civil and criminal proceedings, and even termination of the con- tractual relationship. As part of the regular review and further development of the Code of Ethics, the section on sustainability was expanded in the year under review to include the Deka Group's nine sus- tainability principles. ( CF. CHAPTER 2.2.1.
749;DekaBank_Deutsche_Girozentrale_2022_EN;70;1;;;;;;;;;;;) In these principles, the Deka Group specifies the services it provides to support its customers and partners in taking sustainability criteri a into ac- count in their investments and in the transformation towards a climate -friendly economy. Secondly, the sustainability princi- ples define key areas of action for the ongoing development of the Deka Group's climate and sustainability management.
750;DekaBank_Deutsche_Girozentrale_2022_EN;70;1;;;;;;;;;;;Through their integration into the Code of Ethics, the nine principles are also subject of annual employee appraisals. 5.1.2. External regulations and standards In addition to internal conduct guidelines, recognition of na- tional and international standards also unde rlines the Deka Group's commitment to sustainable development. This in- cludes signing the UN Global Compact and the associated commitment to implement ten principles of responsible corpo- rate governance.
751;DekaBank_Deutsche_Girozentrale_2022_EN;70;1;;;;;;;;;;;They relate to the topic areas of human and labour rig hts, environmental protection and anti -corruption, and thus to the aspects that are also defined as relevant in the CSR Directive Implementation Act (CSR -Richtlinie -Um- setzungsgesetz, CSR -RUG). DekaBank has also committed to complying with the Equator Principles (EP), which focus on taking social and environmental standards into account in international project financing.
752;DekaBank_Deutsche_Girozentrale_2022_EN;70;1;;;;;;;;;;;In 2022, DekaBank supported a total of four (2021: 4) financings under the EP requirements. All four projects were assigned to category B (limited social and environmental impact) (2021: 2 category B, 2 category C). DekaBank reports annually on the implementation of the principles in the relevant financings in accordance with the EP provisions. This report is published on the EP website.
753;DekaBank_Deutsche_Girozentrale_2022_EN;70;1;;;;;;;;;;;F urther information on the consideration of sustainability criteria in lending business is provided in CHAP- TER 4.1.2. The signatories of the PRI undertake to comply with a total of six principles for responsible investment.
754;DekaBank_Deutsche_Girozentrale_2022_EN;70;1;;;;;;;;;;;These include the in- clusion of ESG issues in the analysis and decision -making pro- cesses in the investment area, the consideration of ESG criteria within the framework of active ownership, and regular report- ing on the measures taken to implement the principles within the framework of the Transparency Report, which is available on the PRI website.

Compliance and taxes 5.2.1.
757;DekaBank_Deutsche_Girozentrale_2022_EN;71;0;;;;;;;;;;;Compliance Compliance plays a key role in ensuring that the Deka Group acts in accordance with the applicable statutory and regulatory provisions. The Compliance corporate centre combines the ar- eas of capital market and property compliance , the financial crime uni t and corporate compliance.
758;DekaBank_Deutsche_Girozentrale_2022_EN;71;0;;;;;;;;;;;The Central Financial Crime Unit is responsible for combating money laundering, countering terrorist financing , fraud prevention measures, combating criminal offences and corru ption , as well as imple- menting financial sanction s and embargoes. The Compliance corporate centre develops group-wide stand- ards and guidelines for the Deka Group in the areas, for which it is responsible on the basis o f applicable statutory and regula- tory requirements.
759;DekaBank_Deutsche_Girozentrale_2022_EN;71;0;;;;;;;;;;;I t also supports DekaBank's organisational units and the subsidiaries concerned with appropriate training and advice on the implementation , enforcement and further developmen t of regulatory provision s.
760;DekaBank_Deutsche_Girozentrale_2022_EN;71;0;;;;;;;;;;;In addition , the division is involved in projects and processe s – in particular new prod- uct/marke t processe s, product approval processes, significant changes to the operational and organisational structure and outsourcing – and, as part of its duties, works to ensure that the Deka Group complies with regulatory requiremen ts and identifies any conflicts o f interest at an early stage, avoid s or manages them where possible or discloses them as a last re- sort.
761;DekaBank_Deutsche_Girozentrale_2022_EN;71;0;;;;;;;;;;;To comply with the applicable legal and regulatory require- ments, procedure s and controls are implemented in the spe- cialised units, but al so in the Compliance unit itsel f. They serve to identify and manage compliance risks and to prevent and detec t irregularities.
762;DekaBank_Deutsche_Girozentrale_2022_EN;71;1;;;;;;;;;;;"In order to identify potential compliance risks and work towards their reduction with suitable measures, the unit carries out monitoring and control tasks as a second line of defence in the so-called ""3 Lines of Defence"" model (3LoD). These are an integral part of the Deka Group's compli- ance management system. When identifying and assessing compliance risks, the Compli- ance corporate centre also takes into account risks resulting from sustainability aspects."
763;DekaBank_Deutsche_Girozentrale_2022_EN;71;1;;;;;;;;;;;The Deka Group defines sustaina- bility risks as part of its risk universe, which, due to their re- spective impact, are always viewed in the context of the other risk types and do not const itute separate risk types. Insofar as sustainability risks must be taken into account in the Deka Group's products and services due to legal or regulatory re- quirements, they are also taken into account and reviewed in compliance monitoring activities, cont rols, advice, assessments and training.
764;DekaBank_Deutsche_Girozentrale_2022_EN;71;1;;;;;;;;;;;In this way, the Compliance corporate centre also implements the regulatory tasks specified for a compliance function with regard to sustainability requirements. Based on the requirements of the ECB Guide on Climate and Environmental Risks with regard to the expectations of the compliance function, a package of measures has been defined and is being implemented to take into account potential com- pliance risks from climate and environmental risks in all rele- vant compli ance processes. ( CF.

In the year under review, the flexible use of different work lo- cations continued under the heading ""New Work"". More and more employees are dividing their working time between the office and their home office. The functionality and thus the work results of the Compliance Central Division is not affected by the hybrid working model. On -site audits were partly car- ried out on -site again, partly replaced by the existing technical alternatives."
766;DekaBank_Deutsche_Girozentrale_2022_EN;71;1;;;;;;;;;;;In 2022, the Compliance corporate centre supported the Deka Group's further development of digital assets by advising the bank on its entry into the crypto securities register and on the first-time issue of a crypto security, as well as reviewing the re- lated transactions.
767;DekaBank_Deutsche_Girozentrale_2022_EN;71;1;;;;;;;;;;;In addition, the experts in the Compliance divisio n provided advice on the process and the application for permission to introduce the planned crypto securities custody business, particularly with regard to combating money laun- dering and terrorist financing, criminal offences and compli- ance with financial sanctions and embargoes. There were no significant violations of environmental compli- ance or socioeconomic compliance laws and regulations dur- ing the reporting period.
768;DekaBank_Deutsche_Girozentrale_2022_EN;71;1;;;;;;;;;;;There were no cases, for which fines or non -monetary sanctions were imposed. Likewise, as in pre- vious years, there were no fines for non -compliance with legal and administrative regulations in the year under review. Consulting and training The application and implementation of the regulations and processes for compliance with legal and reg ulatory require- ments often starts with the individual employees.

770;DekaBank_Deutsche_Girozentrale_2022_EN;72;0;;;;;;;;;;; Table of contents 72 training sessions throughout the Deka Group on the topics, fo r which they are responsible. The training concept is generally based on a combination of classroom training with web -based training, online training, special training and training letters. Ad-hoc training courses on selected topics are also offered as needed. In the year under review, face -to-face training was mainly replaced by virtual formats, and individual training ses- sions were held in person.
771;DekaBank_Deutsche_Girozentrale_2022_EN;72;0;;;;;;;;;;;In 2022, the online trainings were transferred to a new admin- istration platform, on which the trainings and their rotation can be managed on the one hand, and on the other hand, the participation of the employees in the trainings can be coordi- nated and ensured. As in previous years, all new employees took part in an initial training course on compliance in th e year under review.
772;DekaBank_Deutsche_Girozentrale_2022_EN;72;0;;;;;;;;;;;In ad- dition, all employees are required to complete web -based training on the topics of money laundering prevention, fraud prevention, financial sanctions/embargoes, capital market compliance and risk culture at the start of their empl oyment and at regular intervals. A total of 50 trainings – including web-based trainings (WBT) – on compliance topics were con- ducted in the year under review.
773;DekaBank_Deutsche_Girozentrale_2022_EN;72;0;;;;;;;;;;;Combating fraud, corruption and bribery DekaBank has set out key elements and principles, includ ing associated processes and measures, for an effective fraud pre- vention system to prevent criminal acts that could endanger the assets of the bank or the individual companies in a uniform manner in the Deka Group's fraud prevention system.
774;DekaBank_Deutsche_Girozentrale_2022_EN;72;0;;;;;;;;;;;In addition, i n connection with the fight against corruption, the framework conditions, under which gifts and invitations, as well as the granting of any other benefits from and to third parties, may be accepted or extended have been defined for the Deka Group. The appr oval process is binding for all em- ployees, including the Board of Management.
775;DekaBank_Deutsche_Girozentrale_2022_EN;72;0;;;;;;;;;;;In principle, employees may not request or accept gifts or invi- tations in connection with their work, either for themselves or for third parties, or grant such gifts or invitations to the extent that the interests of the Deka Group or its customers could be adversely affected as a result. Provided it complies with the ap- plicable laws and standards, the granting of gifts and invita- tions is, to a certain extent, compatible with standard market practice.
776;DekaBank_Deutsche_Girozentrale_2022_EN;72;0;;;;;;;;;;;However, as the professional independence of all par- ties involved may be called into question here, employees are required to avoid even the mere appearance of conflicts of in- terest. The experts in the Compliance department are available to all employees as contact persons for questions on integrity issues. Their contact details are communicated to employees when they join the company as part of the induction training for new employees and are accessible on the Intranet at al l times.
777;DekaBank_Deutsche_Girozentrale_2022_EN;72;0;;;;;;;;;;;For the Deka Group, the risk of corruption is regularly surveyed and assessed as part of the Fraud Prevention Forum. The over- all assessment as of 31 December 2022 showed a medium risk overall, i.e. after applying the safeguards, a comparatively l ow residual risk remains. As in previous years, there was no infor- mation in 2022 that employees were under investigation by the criminal prosecution authorities for corruption offences.

779;DekaBank_Deutsche_Girozentrale_2022_EN;72;1;;;;;;;;;;;This ensures transparency regarding customers and the underlying shareholder structure in Germany as well as in the subsidiari es. The Deka Group's overall risk with regard to money laundering and terrorist financing has been classified as low based on the annual risk analysis.
780;DekaBank_Deutsche_Girozentrale_2022_EN;72;1;;;;;;;;;;;"Furthermore, DekaBank, as the parent company, defines re- quirements for compliance with applicable sanct ions and em- bargoes and for the implementation of sanctions -related measures through the ""Group -wide minimum standards on fi- nancial sanctions""."
781;DekaBank_Deutsche_Girozentrale_2022_EN;72;1;;;;;;;;;;;Particularly against the backdrop of the dy- namic, complex and uncertain development of the sanctions environment due to the Russian war of aggression on Ukraine in 2022, identifying risks, complying with sanctions and main- taining sanctions compliance is essential for the Deka Group. In order to identify and control risks related to sanctions and embargoes, transactio ns and customer/business partner port- folios are checked against applicable sanctions lists, among other things.
782;DekaBank_Deutsche_Girozentrale_2022_EN;72;1;;;;;;;;;;;In addition, a technical solution has been imple- mented for sanctions checks on trading in financial instru- ments. Whistleblower system The Deka Group's compliance system includes a whistleblower system.
783;DekaBank_Deutsche_Girozentrale_2022_EN;72;1;;;;;;;;;;;This ensures that information from employees and also from external persons about potential and actual breaches of legal regulations and requirements, in particular the Money Laundering Act, as wel l as illegal or dishonest actions, can be reported in confidence to DekaBank's external ombudsman. The ombudsman examines the facts of the case and forwards the relevant information to DekaBank while maintaining confi- dentiality. As a lawyer, he is subject to the lawyer's duty of confidentiality.
784;DekaBank_Deutsche_Girozentrale_2022_EN;72;1;;;;;;;;;;;The whistleblower system thus ensures the an- onymity and protection of whistleblowers. In the year under review, the whistleblower system was supplemented with legal requirements concerning section 8 of the Act on Co rporate.

786;DekaBank_Deutsche_Girozentrale_2022_EN;73;0;;;;;;;;;;;Conflicts of interest The Board of Management is responsible for establishing, ap- proving and monitoring the implementation and maintenance of effective policies to ide ntify, assess, manage and mitigate actual and potential conflicts of interest and has tasked the Compliance corporate centre with managing conflicts of inter- est. The Deka Group has implemented principles for dealing with conflicts of interest that apply to all employees and all relevant group companies.
787;DekaBank_Deutsche_Girozentrale_2022_EN;73;0;;;;;;;;;;;According to the principles, all appropriate precautions must be taken to identify and avoid or manage conflicts of interest. If conflicts of interest cannot be avoided or sufficiently managed, they must b e disclosed as a last resort.

789;DekaBank_Deutsche_Girozentrale_2022_EN;73;0;;;;;;;;;;;If employees of the Deka Group have indications that conflicts of interest actually or potentially exist, these must be reported immediately to the Compliance corporate ce ntre in order to have it examined as to whether a conflict of interest exists.
790;DekaBank_Deutsche_Girozentrale_2022_EN;73;0;;;;;;;;;;;In addition, the Compliance unit, with the involvement of the rel- evant specialist unit, assesses whether the measures already taken or planned for prevention, resolution or moni toring are sufficient, whether the management or other internal units should be informed and whether disclosure of the conflict of interest is required. Conflict of interest management is the subject of regular com- pliance reports.
791;DekaBank_Deutsche_Girozentrale_2022_EN;73;0;;;;;;;;;;;The reports contain info rmation on the activi- ties, in which a conflict of interest has arisen or may arise in the course of ongoing activities, as well as on the measures taken to manage, avoid or mitigate the conflict of interest. If necessary, an ad hoc report may be made.
792;DekaBank_Deutsche_Girozentrale_2022_EN;73;0;;;;;;;;;;;The described con- flict of interest management also includes the conflicts of in- terest in relation to ■ membership of another body, ■ cross -shareholdings with suppliers and other stakeholders, and ■ related parties, their relationships, transactions and out- standing balances. 5.2.2. Taxes Taxes are a state's most important source of revenue for the fulfilment of its sovereign tasks, especially the comprehensive provision of services of general interest for its citizens.
793;DekaBank_Deutsche_Girozentrale_2022_EN;73;1;;;;;;;;;;;Taxes therefore also serve to fulfil the ta sks associated with the sus- tainable development of states, as defined, for example, in the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) of the United Nations. For the Deka Group, these form an important reference for the orientation of its sustainability -related g oals and measures.
794;DekaBank_Deutsche_Girozentrale_2022_EN;73;1;;;;;;;;;;;Against this backdrop, as part of the Sparkassen -Finanzgruppe with its public -law sponsorship, the Deka Group takes full ac- count of the applicable tax law requirements in all relevant business activities and in all its companies. Wherev er it oper- ates, the Deka Group complies with the applicable tax laws and regulations in relation to its own tax liabilities and all banking services and products offered.
795;DekaBank_Deutsche_Girozentrale_2022_EN;73;1;;;;;;;;;;;"The Deka Group communicates actively, transparently and constructively with the rele vant tax authorities as required. Tax evasion is illegal and contrary to the Deka Group's corpo- rate culture, values and beliefs. DekaBank and the operating subsidiaries have appointed a tax compliance officer, who also performs this function for the non -operating companies; the basis for this is the agency agreement between DekaBank and the respective company."
796;DekaBank_Deutsche_Girozentrale_2022_EN;73;1;;;;;;;;;;;The independence of the tax co mpli- ance officer is ensured by the direct reporting line to the Board of Management or the management of the respective com- pany within the Deka Group. The latter is informed of the rele- vant issues in regular exchanges with the tax compliance of- ficer and in quarterly reporting as part of the compliance re- port. The compliance report is also presented to the Audit Committee of the Administrative Board of DekaBank.
797;DekaBank_Deutsche_Girozentrale_2022_EN;73;1;;;;;;;;;;;In 2021, a tax compliance management system (Tax CMS) was implemented for the Deka Group, which was certified by an external auditor in accordance with the principles of proper auditing of compliance management systems of the Institute of Public Auditors in Germany (IDW PS 980). The initial audit of the effectiveness of the Tax CMS started in October 2022.
798;DekaBank_Deutsche_Girozentrale_2022_EN;73;1;;;;;;;;;;;A key component of the Tax CMS is the tax guideline, which is binding for the Deka Group and is structured according to the seven basic elements of the Tax CMS in accordance with IDW PS 980. One of these basic elements is the tax compliance culture , un- der which the Deka Group undertakes not to engage in ag- gressive tax planning or artificial, abusive tax structuring with- out reference to actual economic performance.
799;DekaBank_Deutsche_Girozentrale_2022_EN;73;1;;;;;;;;;;;This applies both to tax positions within the Deka Group itself and to its products an d services. To this end, the Tax Policy contains binding rules that apply to all employees of the Deka Group. The main objective of the Tax CMS is to implement and main- tain tax processes that fully comply with legal requirements in.
800;DekaBank_Deutsche_Girozentrale_2022_EN;74;0;;;;;;;;;;;"Table of contents 74 order to avert any tax liability risks. This al so includes the im- plementation of appropriate practices for the prevention , iden- tification and investigation of tax risks (Tax CMS as part of the ""3 Lines of Defence"" approach). The views and concerns of stakeholde rs are of particular im- portance to the Deka Group and are firmly anchored in the Code of Ethics, among other things, which thus also indirectly affects tax issues."
801;DekaBank_Deutsche_Girozentrale_2022_EN;74;0;;;;;;;;;;;In addition, DekaBank is in close direct pro- fessional contact with the tax authorities, the Hessian Ministry of Finance (HMdF ) and the Federal Ministry of Finance (BMF) on tax issues. DekaBank can indirectly express its position on certain tax issues via the association s, e.g . DSGV, BVI , Bun- desverband Öffentliche r Banken Deutschland s (VÖB) and Deutscher Derivate Verband (DDV) .
802;DekaBank_Deutsche_Girozentrale_2022_EN;74;0;;;;;;;;;;;Further professional ex- changes on DekaBank's tax issues may take place through the Bank's own statements, contribution s and participation in working groups of the associations, particularly if DekaBank and/or its stakeholders could be affected by the tax law changes or thei r interpretation. The Deka Group is committed to complete , accurate and timely tax reporting to meet external reporting obligations.
803;DekaBank_Deutsche_Girozentrale_2022_EN;74;0;;;;;;;;;;;This include s, among other things, the publication of tax infor- mation in the IFRS consolidated financial statements, which contain the information on income taxes, as well as country- by-country reporting . The documen ts are published regularly on DekaBank's website . The tax rate published in the IFRS con- solidated financial statemen ts is regularly higher than the standard tax rate. The increased tax rate is due in particular to the non-deductibility of the German bank levy .
804;DekaBank_Deutsche_Girozentrale_2022_EN;74;0;;;;;;;;;;;This effect is partially offset by the application of the lower tax rate at the Luxembourg companies. In this respec t, the IFRS consolidated financial statements al so show no evidence of tax savings. Services within the DekaBank Group are generally charged ac- cording to their cause using the cost-plus method , whereby the specific profit mark-up is determined by the Tax depart- ment. In justified exceptional cases, the cost-plus method is deviated from in favour of the profit-spli t method .
805;DekaBank_Deutsche_Girozentrale_2022_EN;74;0;;;;;;;;;;;All decisions made by the tax department are based on internationally valid transfe r pricing rules, and the tax department strives to ensure that transfe r price s are derived methodically and correctly, and that they are accepted by all parties involved . In Germany, transfe r prices are reviewed annually as part of the timely tax audit, regularly represented by the Federal Central Tax Office. 5.3. Risk management 5.3.1.
806;DekaBank_Deutsche_Girozentrale_2022_EN;74;1;;;;;;;;;;;Definitio n and delimitation of sustainabili ty risks The Deka Group defines sustainability risk as the risk that busi- ness activities with links to the areas of climate and the envi- ronmen t, social affairs or corporate governance may lead to sustaina bility-driven developments or events that result in a de- terioration in capital resources or liquidity, either directly through the Deka Group's own business operations or indi- rectly through customers and business partners.
807;DekaBank_Deutsche_Girozentrale_2022_EN;74;1;;;;;;;;;;;The regulatory focus in this co ntext is on climate and environ- mental risks. For example, the EU taxonomy of sustainable economic activities currently refers to six climate and environ- mental objectives and the ECB has formulated expectations in its guidance on risk management and disclos ure with regard to climate and environmental risks. Against this background too, climate and environmental risks are currently of particular importance to the Deka Group in the context of risk management.
808;DekaBank_Deutsche_Girozentrale_2022_EN;74;1;;;;;;;;;;;Information on dealing with these risks is summar ised in chapter 6.3 . 5.3.2. Key points of climate and environmental risk management To ensure a uniform understanding of climate and environ- mental risks throughout the Deka Group, these risks are clearly defined and classified as part of a risk taxonomy.
809;DekaBank_Deutsche_Girozentrale_2022_EN;74;1;;;;;;;;;;;A basic dis- tinction is made between risks that directly affect the Deka Group and its business operations and those that indirectly af- fect it through its business activities, for example in lending business. The specific impact of the risks on the Deka Group depends, among other things, on the current portfolio, the macroeconomic environme nt and the specific climate and en- vironmental risk.
810;DekaBank_Deutsche_Girozentrale_2022_EN;74;1;;;;;;;;;;;To examine these risks in detail, a catalogue of drivers of spe- cific climate and environmental risks was developed, describing the fundamental impact chains and transmission channels on market participa nts as well as the Deka Group’s business oper- ations and activities. The aim of the risk driver analysis is to identify significant risk drivers for the Deka Group and thus create transparency regarding business model -specific vulnera- bilities.
811;DekaBank_Deutsche_Girozentrale_2022_EN;74;1;;;;;;;;;;;A structured business environment analysis is used to create transparency regarding changes in the Deka Group’s business environment driven by climate and environmental risks and their impact on its business model. The internal stress testing programme is continuously being developed. The scenarios used currently cover both physical and transitory risks.
812;DekaBank_Deutsche_Girozentrale_2022_EN;74;2;;;;;;;;;;;The scenarios used in the stress testing were also developed taking into account the scenarios pub- lished by the Network for Greening the Financial System (NGFS) and th e ECB stress test on climate and environmental risks. Furthermore, climate and environmental risks within the Deka Group are limited by procedures and qualitative guard rails (in- cluding negative lists, minimum standards for financing, sus- tainability filte rs for own investments). ESG scorecards were.
813;DekaBank_Deutsche_Girozentrale_2022_EN;75;0;;;;;;;;;;;Table of contents 75 developed for all segments of lending business and integrated into the existing lending process. These serve, among other things, the initial development of a data basis in order to de- rive target -oriented measur es for the management of climate and environmental risks in the financing portfolio. ( CF. CHAP- TER 4.1.2.
814;DekaBank_Deutsche_Girozentrale_2022_EN;75;0;;;;;;;;;;;) Currently, the climate and environmental risk drivers for the established material risk types are predominantly classified as not significant on the basis of the analyses carried out. With regard to business risk, transitory climate and environmental risks can represent significant drivers under stressed assump- tions, regardless of the probability of occurrence of such events and developments.
815;DekaBank_Deutsche_Girozentrale_2022_EN;75;0;;;;;;;;;;;In addition, it should be noted for operational risks that the significance of transitory climate and environmental risks will increase in the future in view of grow- ing portfolio s in products with sustainability features in con- nection with the increase in regulatory requirements. Against this backdrop too, the Deka Group is planning further measures to integrate climate and environmental risks into risk management.
816;DekaBank_Deutsche_Girozentrale_2022_EN;75;0;;;;;;;;;;;These include , in particular, the continuous re- finement of the business environment and risk driver analysis, the development of a climate strategy and the further develop- ment of internal and external reporting.
817;DekaBank_Deutsche_Girozentrale_2022_EN;75;0;;;;;;;;;;;For the purpose of monitoring and limiting, suitable perf ormance and risk indica- tors will be selected in the future (key performance and key risk indicators), which will enable a regular assessment of the potential impact of climate and environmental risks, taking into account strategic business objectives. Detailed information on the processes and instruments used in the analysis, assessment and management of cli- mate and environmental risks can be found in chapter 6 . 5.3.3.
818;DekaBank_Deutsche_Girozentrale_2022_EN;75;0;;;;;;;;;;;Dealing with sustainability -related reputational risks The interdependencies of sustainability risks in the context of reputational risks are taken into account through proactive reputation management. In order to effectively and consist- ently address reputational risks, the Deka Group ha s estab- lished a uniform group -wide methodology and governance for managing reputational risks in connection with its business ac- tivities.
819;DekaBank_Deutsche_Girozentrale_2022_EN;75;0;;;;;;;;;;;"In this context, sustainability -driven aspects are taken into account as part of the risk inventory and business pro- cesses. Within the framework of the ""3 Lines of Defence"" model, the 1LoD – in the case of counterparty risks with the involvement of the 2LoD in the back office function – identifies the reputational risk inherent in the activities, for which it is re- sponsib le and makes an initial assessment."
820;DekaBank_Deutsche_Girozentrale_2022_EN;75;1;;;;;;;;;;;"Above a defined risk level, a business activity may no longer be approved on its own authority. If the 1LoD continues to adhere to its plan, the 2LoD, in this case the reputation management function, must conduct an independent second assessmen t of the business activity ; if this confirms a significantly increased criticality from the group's point of view , the final approval authority lies with the Board of Management."
821;DekaBank_Deutsche_Girozentrale_2022_EN;75;1;;;;;;;;;;;The reputation managemen t mandate for the independent second assessment is carried out under the joint responsibility of the Risk Control and Board Staff & Communication s units in the Reputational Risk Task Force.
822;DekaBank_Deutsche_Girozentrale_2022_EN;75;1;;;;;;;;;;;"Its mandate is to inde- pendently assess, as objectively as possible, the short to me- dium-term consequences o f all relevant business activities for the Deka Group's reputation vis-à-vis its stakeholders, with a Board of Management reservation for activities assessed as critical ; the assessment framework for the vote is the compa- ny's business and risk strategy. 5.4. Data protection and information security 5.4.1."
823;DekaBank_Deutsche_Girozentrale_2022_EN;75;1;;;;;;;;;;;Data protection Basics and organisation DekaBank's Data Protection unit works to ensure that the data protection regulations of the General Data Protection Regula- tion (GDPR) and the German Federal Data Protection Act (Bun- desdatenschutzgesetz, BDSG) as well as other data protection - related regulations are complied with in the Deka Group.
824;DekaBank_Deutsche_Girozentrale_2022_EN;75;1;;;;;;;;;;;The data protection officer and his deputy have been appointed for DekaBank and its domestic subsidiaries, with the exception of the subsidiary S Broker AG & Co. KG, which has its own data protection officer. Data protecti on requirements are implemented within the framework of the processes and specifications of the data pro- tection management system (Datenschutz -Management -Sys- tem, DSMS).
825;DekaBank_Deutsche_Girozentrale_2022_EN;75;1;;;;;;;;;;;These processes include, in particular, the protec- tion of data subjects' rights, the fu lfilment of information obli- gations towards customers and employees and the documen- tation of processing activities. In order to be able to react quickly to changes in the regulatory framework, we systemati- cally monitor legal developments, case law and publ ications by data protection supervisory authorities.
826;DekaBank_Deutsche_Girozentrale_2022_EN;75;1;;;;;;;;;;;Necessary measures are implemented within the framework of the processes and specifications of the DSMS. Raising awareness and informing employees Pursuant to Section 39 (1a and b) of the GDPR, data pro tec- tion officers must familiarise all employees involved in the pro- cessing of personal data with the aim and content of the data protection regulations. In this context, the employees of the Deka Group are obligated in writing to maintain confidentiality in accordance with the GDPR.
827;DekaBank_Deutsche_Girozentrale_2022_EN;75;1;;;;;;;;;;;They are also informed about their rights and obligations as persons acting in data protection and about the risks for the.

This also includes in formation about pos- sible sanctions as a result of violations of the data protection and data security compliance measures. In order to raise awareness of data protection and inform about new regulatory developments, all employees are regu- larly trained on how to deal with these risks and on the re- quirements of data protection.
829;DekaBank_Deutsche_Girozentrale_2022_EN;76;0;;;;;;;;;;;Data protection coordinators also support as an interface in the specialist departments in communicating and implementing the requirements of data protection law. Audits and reportin g The data protection officer also monitors compliance with the requirements of data protection law. In doing so, the corre- sponding monitoring activities are carried out on the basis of a multi -year risk -oriented control plan.
830;DekaBank_Deutsche_Girozentrale_2022_EN;76;0;;;;;;;;;;;"The results of the audits are made transparent to the departments; if necessary, reme- dial measures are agreed upon and implementation is tracked. In the year under review 2022, the monitoring plan was properly implemented. The Board of Management of DekaBank and the management teams of the subsidiaries are regularly informed about the re- sults of data protection audits and potential data protection risks."
831;DekaBank_Deutsche_Girozentrale_2022_EN;76;0;;;;;;;;;;;In addition, a regular meeting is held with the chief risk officer to discuss current data protection issues. 5.4.2. Information security Information security management in accordance with ISO 27001 DekaBank's Information Security Management System (ISMS) comprises guidelines, structures and processes as well as tech- nical functions designed to ensure appropriate handling of in- formation risks.
832;DekaBank_Deutsche_Girozentrale_2022_EN;76;0;;;;;;;;;;;DekaBank's aim is to protect the bank and its customers and partners from information risks while ensuring the protection objectives of confidentiality, integrity and availa- bility for business and customer information. Central management of information s ecurity is the responsibil- ity of DekaBank's information security officer, who has a direct reporting line to the Board of Management.
833;DekaBank_Deutsche_Girozentrale_2022_EN;76;0;;;;;;;;;;;Based on Deka- Bank's information security strategy, he sets appropriate secu- rity requirements to achieve the defined securi ty level for the entire Deka Group, which also apply to DekaBank's relevant service providers. In designing the measures, the ISMS is guided by the requirements of ISO 27001, an internationally recognised standard for information security.
834;DekaBank_Deutsche_Girozentrale_2022_EN;76;0;;;;;;;;;;;When defining i nformation security methods and procedures, DekaBank maintains contacts with security organisations, gov- ernment authorities and industry associations and coordinates with other banks from the Sparkassen -Finanzgruppe in order to identify and respond to risk -prone developments in the area of information security at an early stage. The exchange also helps to keep approaches and methods for ensuring infor- mation security up to date.
835;DekaBank_Deutsche_Girozentrale_2022_EN;76;1;;;;;;;;;;;Internal and external monitoring actions In order to be able to identify and avoid cyber threats, Deka- Bank has established information security requirements at the data, application, system and infrastructure levels and there- fore for all areas of activity required under ISO 27001.
836;DekaBank_Deutsche_Girozentrale_2022_EN;76;1;;;;;;;;;;;Compli- ance with the requirements, both in the Deka Group compa- nies and at the service providers, is regularly monitored in or- der to identify information risks at an early stage and deal with them appropriately. In addition, an external audit based on the ISO 27001 standa rd is carried out every two years to check the functionality and effectiveness of the ISMS.
837;DekaBank_Deutsche_Girozentrale_2022_EN;76;1;;;;;;;;;;;In order to ensure adequate transparency on information risks, the Board of Management and the respective management of the subordinate companies are informed on a quarterly basis within the framework of an established reporting on existing information risks as well as their status in terms of risk treat- ment. Training and awareness measures All Deka Group employees are responsible for complying with information se curity policies and procedures.
838;DekaBank_Deutsche_Girozentrale_2022_EN;76;1;;;;;;;;;;;In order to raise awareness of information risks and keep them informed of new developments, all employees receive regular training on how to deal with these risks and ensure information security. Business Continuity Manag ement DekaBank operates an efficient Business Continuity Manage- ment (BCM) system that ensures the continuation of time -criti- cal business processes in the event of an emergency.
839;DekaBank_Deutsche_Girozentrale_2022_EN;76;1;;;;;;;;;;;In addi- tion to taking precautions against emergencies, the manage- ment of crisis situations is also taken into account. The focus is on four possible failure scenarios: ■ Infrastructure failure (e.g. buildings) ■ IT system failure (e.g. applications and office communica- tion) ■ Staff shortage ■ Service provider failure These scenarios also include possibl e climate change -related events, for example an infrastructure failure due to extreme weather events.
840;DekaBank_Deutsche_Girozentrale_2022_EN;76;1;;;;;;;;;;;For the systematic identification of risks, all business processes are regularly reviewed within the frame- work of a Business Impact Analysis (BIA) with re gard to the possible effects of the scenarios. If necessary, measures are taken and resources are made available to reduce failure risks and their possible consequences. For example, time -critical ap- plications are hosted redundantly in the data centres. Fo r all time-critical processes and resources, contingency or business.
841;DekaBank_Deutsche_Girozentrale_2022_EN;77;0;;;;;;;;;;;Table of contents 77 continuity plans are prepared by the departments and updated at lea st annually . These contain both fallback procedures for the failure of a resource and the return of the affected process to normal operation. All measures are regularly checked for thei r effectiveness and appropriateness and tested in practice .
842;DekaBank_Deutsche_Girozentrale_2022_EN;77;0;;;;;;;;;;;The tests cover all four failure scenarios so tha t, for example , the alternative locations and IT solutions provided for the building failure can be exam- ined for their functionality . In addition to the internal tests, DekaBank's service provide rs are also checked to ensure that IT service providers, for example , can guarantee the contractually agreed availability times for the respective applications in emergency situation s.
843;DekaBank_Deutsche_Girozentrale_2022_EN;77;0;;;;;;;;;;;In addition , annual risk-oriented BCM audits of the service provide rs are carried out to check whether they are able to provide their services on a permanent basis. 5.5. Complaint management The Deka Group has implemented a management system for customer complaints that ensures an effective and transparent procedure for dealing with complaints. Among other thing s, it ensures tha t incoming custo mer complaints are forwarded im- mediately to the relevant specialist unit and processed there.
844;DekaBank_Deutsche_Girozentrale_2022_EN;77;0;;;;;;;;;;;This i s also where tips and suggestions for improvement from the complaints can be recorded. The European Commission has set up a European online dis- pute resolution platform that consumers can use to settle dis- putes arising from sales or service contracts concluded online out of cou rt.
845;DekaBank_Deutsche_Girozentrale_2022_EN;77;0;;;;;;;;;;;Custome rs also have the option of submitting their complaints to the DSGV's consumer arbitration board and the ombudsman's office of the German Investmen t and Asset Management Association (Bundesverband Investment und Asset Managemen t, BVI), as well as to the German Fed- eral Financial Supervisory Authority (BaFin ) or the Luxembourg supervisory authority Commission de Surveillance du Secteur Financier (CSSF ) and the Joint Conciliation Board of the Aus- trian banking industry .
846;DekaBank_Deutsche_Girozentrale_2022_EN;77;0;;;;;;;;;;;In the year under review , the Deka Group received 115 complaints (2021: 69) via these channels. In this respec t, customers show an increasing willingness to clarify concerns – howeve r, there were no main thematic prior- ities. During the reporting period , there were no complaints relating to environmental issues submitted via formal procedures. No complaints were al so submitted on the subject of corruption or the human rights impact of the Deka Group's activities.

Idea and innovation management 5.6.1. Idea management DekaBank's idea management for the Deka Group runs via a web-based platform that employees of the Deka Group can use to submit their ideas fo r improving processe s or fo r new products and services.
848;DekaBank_Deutsche_Girozentrale_2022_EN;77;1;;;;;;;;;;;The crow d-sourcing approach of this platform enables employees to actively participate in the fur- ther developmen t and evaluation of the published ideas. Indi- cations of potential problems and risks are also helpful for the department concerned , which decides whethe r an idea should be implemented .
849;DekaBank_Deutsche_Girozentrale_2022_EN;77;1;;;;;;;;;;;"In addition to the Deka Group, 40 other sav- ings banks or affiliated institutions are curre ntly using the ""S- Innovation"" platform developed by DSGV, DekaBank and Sparkassen-Finanzportal for their idea management. In the year under review , employees submitted a total of 100 (2021: 148) ideas, of which 68 (2021: 91) were published on the platform . The decrease in submissions i s mainly explained by the fact tha t in 2022 – unlike in the two previous yea rs – no ideas competition was held ."
850;DekaBank_Deutsche_Girozentrale_2022_EN;77;1;;;;;;;;;;;Ideas on ESG topics again played a major role (24 percent of idea s). The very high rate of 51 percen t from the previous yea r could not be achieved because there was no special sustainability competition in 2022 . The category was not able to maintain its top position in terms of ideas submitted and reached second place in the year under review in terms of the numbe r of proposals submitted .
851;DekaBank_Deutsche_Girozentrale_2022_EN;77;1;;;;;;;;;;;Pro- posals for the design of processes ranked first with 28 percent, while concrete ideas for real estate management ranked third with a share of 18 percen t. These mainly concern the new building in Niederrad (LS 13) and include, for example , sugges- tions for further reducing electricity and water consumption. 17 ideas were awarded cash prizes totalling 32,050 euros, and 13 other employees received non-ca sh prizes.
852;DekaBank_Deutsche_Girozentrale_2022_EN;77;1;;;;;;;;;;;The savings or additional income from the suggestions increased significantly to 145,200 euros (2021 : 31,000 euros). Responsible for this were mainly an idea on fees in the context of securities lending and an idea on switching providers for terminals for financial information and market data. The winning ideas from the #GemeinsamNachhaltig (#Sustain- ableTogethe r) competition , which was held in autumn 2021, could be implemented for the most pa rt in 2022.
853;DekaBank_Deutsche_Girozentrale_2022_EN;77;1;;;;;;;;;;;The tree planting campaign recommended by the jury took place on 8 October 2022 at Treisberg in Taunu s. The employees of the Deka Group and their familie s were invited to take part in the campaign . Around 60 people planted 500 trees under the guidance of the forest ranger. In addition , Schutzgemeinschaft Deutscher Wald e. V. (German Forest Protection Association) received a donation of 5,000 euros from DekaBank.
854;DekaBank_Deutsche_Girozentrale_2022_EN;77;2;;;;;;;;;;;"The idea of ""old smartphones in exchange for money/donation and for the environment"" was also implemented. Green col- lection boxes from the company Teqcycle were set up at the."

856;DekaBank_Deutsche_Girozentrale_2022_EN;78;0;;;;;;;;;;;The ideas with the best rating s are awarded a cash bonus of 400 euros. 5.6.2. Innovatio n management In addition to ideas managemen t, strategic innovation man- agement has been further developed as part of the strategic action programme 2025 .
857;DekaBank_Deutsche_Girozentrale_2022_EN;78;0;;;;;;;;;;;This relies on the participation of as many employees a s possible in the developmen t of innovative solutions in order to consolidate the culture of innovation , pro- mote the digital transformation throughout the Deka Group and strengthen the Deka Group's competitiveness . In an end- to-end innovation process , relevant trend s are identified and recommendations for action are derived.
858;DekaBank_Deutsche_Girozentrale_2022_EN;78;0;;;;;;;;;;;Together with the specialist units, concrete approaches to solutions are gener- ated from these and validated as part o f innovation manage- ment. The financing of the process is ensured by the innovation board , which decides on the basis of pitches whether the im- plementation of the ideas will be financially supported . In the year under review , three innovation boards took place, at which six ideas were positively evaluated .
859;DekaBank_Deutsche_Girozentrale_2022_EN;78;0;;;;;;;;;;;Thematically , these were ideas and solutions that contribute to the focus technolo- gies of artificial intelligence (AI) and Blockchain & Distributed Ledge r Technology (DLT), among others.

Sustainability rating 5.7.1.
861;DekaBank_Deutsche_Girozentrale_2022_EN;78;1;;;;;;;;;;;Significa nce of sustainability ratings for the Deka Group In the course of the upswing in sustainable capital invest- ments, which is also due to regulatory reasons, the sustainabil- ity ratings prepared by specialised rating agencies have gained further importance.
862;DekaBank_Deutsche_Girozentrale_2022_EN;78;1;;;;;;;;;;;For the vast majority of institutional inves- tors as well as for providers of sustainable investment solu- tions, they provide the information on the sustainability quality of issuers – companies and states – that they need to imple- ment their individual sustainability concepts.
863;DekaBank_Deutsche_Girozentrale_2022_EN;78;1;;;;;;;;;;;In the case of companies, the s ustainability ratings regularly include infor- mation on activities in business areas perceived as controversial or possible violations of recognised standards, such as those defined in the principles of the UN Global Compact.
864;DekaBank_Deutsche_Girozentrale_2022_EN;78;1;;;;;;;;;;;In addi- tion, the agencies compr ehensively assess the quality of the is- suers' sustainability management, whereby future -oriented as- pects, such as the suitability of the issuers' climate strategy for achieving the Paris climate goals, play an increasingly im- portant role in addition to the status quo.
865;DekaBank_Deutsche_Girozentrale_2022_EN;78;1;;;;;;;;;;;Parallel to the increasing influence of sustainability ratings on capital investment, the discussion about the quality and in- formative value of sustainability ratings intensified in the year under review. The starting point was the fact that the different agencies arrive at different assessments of the quality of sus- tainability management and possible violations of sustainability standards for the same issuers.
866;DekaBank_Deutsche_Girozentrale_2022_EN;78;1;;;;;;;;;;;It should be noted that there is currently no standard for assessing the sustainab ility perfor- mance of companies and that agencies take different ap- proaches to assessing companies. The EU Commission has announced that it will pay increased attention to the question of how to improve the informative value and comparability of sustainab ility ratings.
867;DekaBank_Deutsche_Girozentrale_2022_EN;78;1;;;;;;;;;;;In a first step, a central database is to be created with the European Single Access Point (ESAP), in which companies are to provide stand- ardised financial and sustainability data. As an issuer of public bonds, mortgage bonds, bearer bonds and certificates under the Green Bond Framework, it is also important for DekaBank to meet the requirements of the sus- tainability rating agencies so that it can successfully place its bonds with the growing number of sustainability -oriented in- vestors.
868;DekaBank_Deutsche_Girozentrale_2022_EN;78;1;;;;;;;;;;;The sustainability ratings are therefore an important reference for the design of sustainability management and the specialised agencies are a central target group for sustainability reporting. At the same time, the criteria used by the agencies reflect the re quirements of important stakeholders of the Deka Group, such as environmental associations, human rights orga - nisations and trade unions.
869;DekaBank_Deutsche_Girozentrale_2022_EN;78;1;;;;;;;;;;;Finally, the Deka Group uses the sustainability ratings as a basis for analyses of the strengths and weaknesses of its sustainability management, also in com- parison with other banks. ESG issues relating to the ongoing development and implementation of the sustainability strategy are regularly reported in the ESG Circle and, where necessary, submitted to the ESG Committee for a decision. 5.7.2.

Dr. Ulrich Kater, Chief Economist of DekaBank Editorial: Combating the energy crisis and sustainability – opposites or complements? Dr. Ulrich Kater, Chief Economist of DekaBank A bitter realisation of 2022 is that the global economy has seamlessly moved from the Corona crisis to the next crisis, the energy price crisis.
878;DekaBank_Deutsche_Girozentrale_2022_EN;80;0;;;;;;;;;;;The price of natural gas, which after a ten- fold increase in 2022 briefly fell back to pre -crisis levels due to an uncharacteristica lly warm autumn, will continue to fluctu- ate very sharply for some time. In the long term, however, it will probably be higher than before the Russian war of aggres- sion on Ukraine.
879;DekaBank_Deutsche_Girozentrale_2022_EN;80;0;;;;;;;;;;;The return of inflation and the subsequent sharp rise in interest rates are again confronting the economy and the financial markets with completely new framework conditions in a very short time. In addition, there are the issues of recession, the energy crisis and the war in Eastern Europe. This change of perspective raises fears that the new urgencies will push the long -term challenges for the economy and soci- ety, such as climate change or demography, into the back- ground.
880;DekaBank_Deutsche_Girozentrale_2022_EN;80;0;;;;;;;;;;;This applies especially to the debate on the climate and sustainability -related transformation of the economy. The energy crisis is the dominant issue in Europe. Germany has been hit particularly hard because of its high dependence on Russian gas. This is because Russia stopped supplying gas to Germany over the summer of the year under review. In addi- tion, there is a strong global economic downturn, which is not only having a noticeable impact on the German export econ- omy.
881;DekaBank_Deutsche_Girozentrale_2022_EN;80;0;;;;;;;;;;;The European economy is in a prolonged recession. So how does the energy crisis affect the achievement of the trans- formation goals? The answer is not clear: ■ There are changes in the use of energy sources in Germany: these include a postponement of the phase -out of nuclear power. The remaining three nuclear power plants in Ger- many are now to be allowed to continue running until mid - April 2023.
882;DekaBank_Deutsche_Girozentrale_2022_EN;80;0;;;;;;;;;;;S ince uncertainty about the energy situation is also high for the winter of 2023/24, there could be a further extension of operating times. The plan changes in the Ger- man coal industry are somewhat more complex. Here, the phase -out of lignite -fired power pl ants is planned by the end of 2038.
883;DekaBank_Deutsche_Girozentrale_2022_EN;80;0;;;;;;;;;;;In order to support security of supply in the current energy crisis, two coal -fired power plants will not be shut down at the end of 2022 as initially planned, but will con- tinue to run until 2024 with an option for 2025. In order not to miss the targeted climate goals, it was decided to bring forward the closure of three coal -fired power plants from 2038 to 2030.
884;DekaBank_Deutsche_Girozentrale_2022_EN;80;1;;;;;;;;;;;■ These developments are counteracted by the emission ef- fects of the massively increased prices: Firstly, the c yclical slowdown of the economy, e.g. through a decline in pro- duction and transport, also reduces CO 2 emissions – in this respect, the current situation resembles the lockdown ef- fects of the Corona crisis. Secondly, energy consumers are adjusting their dem and to the changed prices.
885;DekaBank_Deutsche_Girozentrale_2022_EN;80;1;;;;;;;;;;;In industry, natural gas consumption fell by 20 percent in the third quar- ter of the year under review alone compared to the average of previous years. How much private households will be able to cut their demand can only be asses sed in the course of 2023, when the winter weather conditions will also be as- sessable. But here, too, the savings and thus lower environ- mental consumption will be substantial.
886;DekaBank_Deutsche_Girozentrale_2022_EN;80;1;;;;;;;;;;;The purely quantitative self -restraint of companies and con- sumers in the face of high energy prices is only the first – and usually not ideal – reaction. In industry, for example, reduced natural gas consumption goes hand in hand with significant production cutbacks or relocations, i.e. lower economic output in this country. For pri vate households, too, the savings mean a direct sacrifice of prosperity. This cannot be a permanent so- lution.
887;DekaBank_Deutsche_Girozentrale_2022_EN;80;1;;;;;;;;;;;The strength of the market -based adjustment reactions, however, lies in the subsequent adjustment steps. These go in the direction of avoiding exp ensive input factors with higher production and prosperity again. A wide range of energy -saving activities have begun, especially among companies. From energy -efficient building manage- ment systems to adjustments in machinery, the measures ranged that alm ost every company in Germany started or pushed this year.
888;DekaBank_Deutsche_Girozentrale_2022_EN;80;1;;;;;;;;;;;Such a reaction has been seen before in eco- nomic history. After the likewise extreme rise in the price of energy raw materials in the 1970s, the German economy in- creased its energy efficiency consid erably: while the gross do- mestic product more than doubled in the following decades, primary energy consumption remained more or less constant. High prices are thus a very effective mechanism for saving, which will come into play again now.
889;DekaBank_Deutsche_Girozentrale_2022_EN;81;0;;;;;;;;;;; Table of contents 81 Editorial No slowdown in the topic of sustainability can be seen in fi- nancial market regulation or environmental policy: ■ For example, the ECB is in the process of significantly sharp- ening and advancing its regulatory framework for a gree n monetary policy, as planned. In July 2022, it decided to con- tribute to climate protection with regard to its corporate bond portfolio.
890;DekaBank_Deutsche_Girozentrale_2022_EN;81;0;;;;;;;;;;;The possibilities for shifting in the ECB's holdings of corporate bonds came into effect on 1 October 2022. It concerns purchases to be unwound in the Corpo- rate Sector Purchase Programme (CSPP) and the Pandemic Emergency Purchase Programme (PEPP). The decarbonisation of the corporate bond portfolio is to be based on an issuer - specific climate score.
891;DekaBank_Deutsche_Girozentrale_2022_EN;81;0;;;;;;;;;;;In addition, the ECB is now trying to integrate biodiversity and other environmental protection as- pects more strongly alongside climate protection. ■ In the EU, the path to decarbonisation without deindustriali- sation continues. The European Commission's Fit -for-55 pro- gramme is cu rrently being discussed in parliament.
892;DekaBank_Deutsche_Girozentrale_2022_EN;81;0;;;;;;;;;;;In partic- ular, this involves the expansion of CO 2 emissions trading and a CO 2 border adjustment mechanism to ensure that producers in Europe do not suffer cost and price disad- vantages due to higher environmental stand ards compared to non -European producers with lower standards. ■ The topic of hydrogen deserves a special mention.
893;DekaBank_Deutsche_Girozentrale_2022_EN;81;0;;;;;;;;;;;It is be- coming increasingly clear that a rapid development of a hy- drogen economy as a storage facility for energy is becoming an important, if not necessary, component of the energy transition towards renewable energy sources. This is also part of the EU environmental policy. Within the framework of the REPowerEU project, the goal of producing 10 million tonnes of hydrogen from renewable energy s ources is an- chored.
894;DekaBank_Deutsche_Girozentrale_2022_EN;81;0;;;;;;;;;;;The fact that the financial leeway in public budgets worldwide is becoming smaller could prove problematic for the achieve- ment of climate and sustainability goals. Until now, the high crisis expenditures of states in the past and the a ssociated ris- ing national debts did not represent major hurdles for future projects, as an extremely low interest rate level provided for an almost unlimited debt potential. Those days are gone with the sharp rise in interest rates.
895;DekaBank_Deutsche_Girozentrale_2022_EN;81;0;;;;;;;;;;;The episode of short -term financial market turmoil in the UK due to high debt plans of the new UK government also indicates that financial markets consider sovereign debt capacities to be largely exhausted. Higher spending on climate and sustainability projects must now come bac k at the expense of spending for other purposes. To- gether with the loss of prosperity for private households due to high inflation rates, acceptance problems could arise here.
896;DekaBank_Deutsche_Girozentrale_2022_EN;81;0;;;;;;;;;;;All in all, the current energy crisis has a variety of effects on tackling clim ate problems. Short -term braking effects due to emergency measures following the abrupt gas supply stop from Russia are countered by medium -term savings effects from expensive natural gas. The unbroken willingness of politi- cians to tackle the climate and s ustainability turnaround is now coming up against slimmer public budgets. In particular, the pass -through of savings effects is important.
897;DekaBank_Deutsche_Girozentrale_2022_EN;81;1;;;;;;;;;;;This results in particular from the effects that high prices have in a market economy. These reduce the demand for the goods that have become scarce and increase the supply. The under- standable desire to cap prices would prevent precisely this re- duction in demand – as well as an expansion of supply – and thus prolong the imbalances. In the worst case, a scenario of extremely expensive permanent subsidies looms.
898;DekaBank_Deutsche_Girozentrale_2022_EN;81;1;;;;;;;;;;;The strength of market economies lies in their ability to adapt quickly and effectively to changing conditions. However, this is only possi- ble if price signals can work. Price signals have the advantage that e ach member of an economy can provide the response best suited to his or her situation, while laws and regulations cannot remotely exhaust these individual response options.
899;DekaBank_Deutsche_Girozentrale_2022_EN;81;1;;;;;;;;;;;The fact that the environmental goals of many countries are nevertheless in danger of not being achieved was also at the forefront of the 27th UN Climate Conference (Conference of the Parties, COP 27) in Egypt in November 2022. Here it be- came apparent that even in the ambitious industrialised coun- tries, the willingness of the populations to accept restrictions and costs is not in line with the necessary measures to achieve the transformation goals.
900;DekaBank_Deutsche_Girozentrale_2022_EN;81;1;;;;;;;;;;;This willingness will be further dam- aged by the recent strains on the world economy caused by the energy crisis and deglobalisation. Therefore, the transfor- mation of the global economy towards a sustainable form of economy remains a major challenge.

Operational responsibility for these aspects is decentralised to the individual departments. The business activities of the subsidiaries are recorded at the lev el of the business divisions.
911;DekaBank_Deutsche_Girozentrale_2022_EN;83;1;;;;;;;;;;;In order to provide the Board of Man- agement and other decision -makers with the relevant infor- mation to fulfil this responsibility, various committees and working groups have been established in the Deka Group in recent years t o deal with climate -related and environmental is- sues.
912;DekaBank_Deutsche_Girozentrale_2022_EN;83;1;;;;;;;;;;;This includes the ESG Committee, which was established at DekaBank at the beginning of 2022 and acts as a decision - making and escalation body for cross -sectional ESG issues and thus also climate -related and environmental issues. The com- mittee consists of members of the DekaBank’s Board of Man- agement and the heads of Strategy & HR (Human Resources), Board Staff & Communications and Risk Control.
913;DekaBank_Deutsche_Girozentrale_2022_EN;83;1;;;;;;;;;;;Depending on the topic and operational responsibility, oth er divisional managers are also involved. As part of the meetings of the ESG Committee, which are held on a quarterly basis, the Board of Management is also informed about climate -related and en- vironmental issues.
914;DekaBank_Deutsche_Girozentrale_2022_EN;83;1;;;;;;;;;;;On this basis, the entire Board of Manage- ment deals with current topics and developments in strategic ESG coordination, the transformation and management of overarching topics including climate -related and environmental risks as well as their cross -sectional management within the framework of the committee. A separate ESG Circle was set up upstream of the ESG Com- mittee.

945;DekaBank_Deutsche_Girozentrale_2022_EN;86;0;;;;;;;;;;;In project portfolio management, all ESG projects and therefore also climate -related and environ- mental projects are marked separately and are therefore easily identifiable. In this context, climate - and environment -related topics are taken into account, for example, in resource and project planning, in sales planning and indirectly through ef- fects on the special assets.
946;DekaBank_Deutsche_Girozentrale_2022_EN;86;0;;;;;;;;;;;With the appropriate materiality, climate - and environment -related topics can al so be taken into account in other relevant areas if required. The findings from the annual analysis of the business environ- ment ( CF. CHAPTER 6.2.1. ) and risk driver analysis ( CF. CHAP- TER 6.3.1. ) can be used as a basis for making adjustments to the Deka Group’s strategic and operational objectives. The successive integration of ESG issues into line processes (CF. CHAPTER 6.3.3.
947;DekaBank_Deutsche_Girozentrale_2022_EN;86;1;;;;;;;;;;;) ensures that relevant information can be continuously incorporated into the business model. With a fo- cus on specific targets for climate and environmental risks, a group -wide project was launched in the year under review to systematically record the Deka Group’s climate -related emis- sions for all relevant business divisions and portfolios. ( CF. CHAPTER 6.4.
948;DekaBank_Deutsche_Girozentrale_2022_EN;86;1;;;;;;;;;;;) This inventory serves in particular as a basis for drawing up sector -based decarbonisation paths for the me- dium and long -term time horizon, taking into account the Paris climate goals and the Deka Group’s own voluntary com- mitments, in order to be able to derive well -founded ambi- tions.
949;DekaBank_Deutsche_Girozentrale_2022_EN;86;1;;;;;;;;;;;For the management of specific overarching or separate aspects of climate and environmental risks, further key perfor- mance indicators (KPIs) and key risk indicators (KRIs) are to be derived in the future in accordance with the strategic, opera- tional and risk strategy objectives.
950;DekaBank_Deutsche_Girozentrale_2022_EN;86;1;;;;;;;;;;;In addition, the Deka Group excludes various types of financ- ing in its negative list of credit risk strategies, including compa- nies that generate more than 30 perce nt of their sales from coal production and/or more than 40 percent from coal -fired power generation and therefore face particularly high transi- tory climate risks and have a particularly high negative impact on the climate. ( CF. CHAPTER 4.1.2.
951;DekaBank_Deutsche_Girozentrale_2022_EN;86;1;;;;;;;;;;;) AMW business field In the AMW business division, the integration of climate -re- lated aspects into business and budget plans was further ad- vanced in the year under review. An important element of the strategic orientation in the topic area climate is the member- ship of Deka Investment GmbH and Deka Vermögensmanage- ment GmbH, which belong to the business division, in NZAM.
952;DekaBank_Deutsche_Girozentrale_2022_EN;86;1;;;;;;;;;;;This also includes the first -time preparation of an Investor Cli- mate Action Plan (IC AP) in 2023, in which the targets and measures for achieving the net zero target are described in more detail. Climate -related and environmental risks within the AMW business division are currently managed in the re- spective business divisions as part of th e management of the relevant risk types.
953;DekaBank_Deutsche_Girozentrale_2022_EN;86;2;;;;;;;;;;;Direct dialogue with the companies, in which investments are made, as well as the use of the voting and speaking rights as- sociated with shares at annual general meetings, have gained in importance as an instrument of sustainable capital invest- ment in recent years and are also used intensively by the AMW business division. ( CF. CHAPTER 4.1.1.2.5. ) When implement- ing corresponding measures in the con text of NZAM, the busi- ness division therefore builds on established processes.
954;DekaBank_Deutsche_Girozentrale_2022_EN;86;2;;;;;;;;;;;For ex- ample, in accordance with its Voting Policy Principles for An- nual General Meetings 2022, Deka Investment GmbH reserves the right to refuse to discharge the Board of Manage ment at AGMs if the expectations defined in the guidelines, for exam- ple for a climate strategy, are not met. AMI business field In the AMI business division, climate -related and environmen- tal aspects are assessed as part of the annual business environ- ment analysis.
955;DekaBank_Deutsche_Girozentrale_2022_EN;86;2;;;;;;;;;;;The results of this analysis are taken into ac- count in the business planning, which is also updated annually, within the framework of the relevant planning parameters and, if necessary, the measures required to deal with the iden- tified risks are initiated.
956;DekaBank_Deutsche_Girozentrale_2022_EN;86;2;;;;;;;;;;;These include, in particular, the adjust- ment and further development of the sustainability strategy and the resulting budget planning, the analysis of potential ef- fects on transactions or the geographical allocation of property portfolios as we ll as possible adjustments in the sales planning of investment funds.

Strategy – Climate aspects in business model and strategy 6.2.1. Identification of climate and environmental risks and opportunities The Deka Group uses various qualitative and quantitative ap- proaches to systematically identify and assess climate and envi- ronmental impacts on the business model and risk landscape over a short, medium and long -term horizon.
958;DekaBank_Deutsche_Girozentrale_2022_EN;87;0;;;;;;;;;;;To create transparency regarding changes in the business envi- ronment driven by climate and environmental risks and their short, medium and long -term impact on the Deka Group's business model and business activities, a structured business environment analysis has been carried out annually since 2021.
959;DekaBank_Deutsche_Girozentrale_2022_EN;87;0;;;;;;;;;;;As part of this analysis, climate and environmental risks and opportunities and their impact on the business model in terms of business activities, products and markets are specifically considered. The systematic identification of climate and environmental risks is subject of the regular risk inventory.
960;DekaBank_Deutsche_Girozentrale_2022_EN;87;0;;;;;;;;;;;For this purpose, a separate risk driver analysis was integrated into the overall context of the risk inventory, which is s pecifically geared to- wards the identification and analysis of climate and environ- mental risks. These approaches are supplemented by scenario analyses on separate aspects of climate and environmental risks within the framework of macroeconomic stress testin g.
961;DekaBank_Deutsche_Girozentrale_2022_EN;87;0;;;;;;;;;;;The methods used currently use different time horizons, de- pending on the individual objective of the analyses, in order to view the Deka Group's diversified business model as compre- hensively as possible. Fundamentals and methodology of the business env iron- ment analysis Climate -related and environmental issues have also been ex- tensively integrated into the Deka Group's process organisa- tion.
962;DekaBank_Deutsche_Girozentrale_2022_EN;87;0;;;;;;;;;;;For example, the structured business environment analy- sis creates comprehensive transparency on changes in the busi- ness environment driven by climate -related and environmental risks and their impact on the business model in various time horizons. The observation horizon of the business environment analysis is currently five years and thus covers the short - to medium - term time horizon.
963;DekaBank_Deutsche_Girozentrale_2022_EN;87;0;;;;;;;;;;;"For the long -term horizon of more than five years, a qualitative observation is made for three defined cli- mate scenarios – ""scheduled transition"", ""delayed transition"" and ""Hot House World"". Procedure for conducting the business environment analysis The business environment analysis is based on individual driv- ers of climate and environmental risks."
964;DekaBank_Deutsche_Girozentrale_2022_EN;87;0;;;;;;;;;;;For this purpose, Deka- Bank has developed a comprehensive catalogue of drivers of climate and environmental risks and described the fundamen- tal impact chain s and transmission channels on market partici- pants as well as the Deka Group's business operations and ac- tivities. Climate and environmental risks were divided into the categories of physical (acute, chronic and non -climatic), transi- tory and other climate and environmental risks.
965;DekaBank_Deutsche_Girozentrale_2022_EN;87;0;;;;;;;;;;;For an aggre- gated view, climate and environmental risks with similar mech- anisms of action were also grouped into specific driver groups. Five key dimensions were derived for the Deka Group for con- sideration: 1. Customers / Distributo rs / Society 2. Competitors 3. Regulatory / Legal 4. Technology 5.
966;DekaBank_Deutsche_Girozentrale_2022_EN;87;1;;;;;;;;;;;"Macroeconomics / Capital Market Characteristics of the climate scenarios us ed ""Scheduled transition"" To combat climate change, the CO 2 price will be continu- ously increased in accordance with the planning commu- nicated by the EU and obsolete and emission -intensive technologies will be banned. Renewable energies are be- ing expanded a nd the requirements for the circular econ- omy are increasing. Extreme weather events occur sporad- ically."
967;DekaBank_Deutsche_Girozentrale_2022_EN;87;1;;;;;;;;;;;"""Delayed transition"" Due to advancing climate change and increased extreme weather events, the CO 2 price will increase drastically from 2030 onward. Innovative and low -emission technologies displace emission -intensive competitors in a short time. Raw material and water prices are rising sharply, while the expansion of renewable energies is being driven forward. Consumer behaviour is strongly influenced by sustainabil- ity."
968;DekaBank_Deutsche_Girozentrale_2022_EN;87;1;;;;;;;;;;;"""Hot House World"" The insufficient efforts of the political community of states have led to global warming well above the 1.5° Celsius target. The absence of bans on emission -intensive technol- ogies and a low CO 2 price as well as associated low transport costs lead to moderate producer prices."
969;DekaBank_Deutsche_Girozentrale_2022_EN;87;1;;;;;;;;;;;How- ever, strong global warming leads to a frequent occur- rence of extreme weather events, an increase in water and air temperature as well as the ab sence of snowfall and a strong increase in water prices. Tropical diseases are also increasingly spreading in the northern hemisphere.
970;DekaBank_Deutsche_Girozentrale_2022_EN;88;0;;;;;;;;;;; Table of contents 88 Climate and Environmental risk s Strategy Reporting As part of the business environment analysis, a structured re- view and description of the impact of climate -related and envi- ronmental risks on the environmental factors and the business model is carried out in internal workshops with experts from relevant areas of the Deka Group, taking into account both risks and opportunities.
971;DekaBank_Deutsche_Girozentrale_2022_EN;88;0;;;;;;;;;;;All business divisions are considered separately, including sales, in the short and medium te rm up to five years. If heterogeneous effects are expected within a business division, the business activities are detailed, e.g. in in- dividual customer groups, product segments or geographical regions.
972;DekaBank_Deutsche_Girozentrale_2022_EN;88;0;;;;;;;;;;;The results of the business environment analysis are incorpo- rated into further, downstream instruments within the frame- work of the strategy process, with a further assessment of rel- evant identified effects on strategic planning as well as finan- cial planning carried out in a next step, taking into account th e time horizon. The business environment analysis is updated annually.
973;DekaBank_Deutsche_Girozentrale_2022_EN;88;0;;;;;;;;;;;In this context, climate -related and environmental risk drivers will be reviewed in the future and the analysis of long -term impacts will be detailed. Results of the business environment analysis The business environment analysis carried out in the year un- der review showed that physical climate and environmental developments and events do not have any considerable impact on the Deka Group's business model in the short to medium term.
974;DekaBank_Deutsche_Girozentrale_2022_EN;88;0;;;;;;;;;;;"In contrast, transitory climate -related and environmental aspects can lead to potential effects on the business model, whereby the two environmental factors under consideration, ""Customers / Distributors / Society"" and ""Regulatory / Legal"", are part icularly relevant. In particular, a further intensification of regulatory measures can have a noticeable impact on the business activities of the business divisions, e.g."
975;DekaBank_Deutsche_Girozentrale_2022_EN;88;0;;;;;;;;;;;in the form of rising personnel and consulting costs for the implementation of additi onally required measures. At the same time, climate change and the fight against its causes and consequences also present opportunities for busi- ness development in the Deka Group's business divisions in the short to medium term.
976;DekaBank_Deutsche_Girozentrale_2022_EN;88;0;;;;;;;;;;;For example, the already noticeable ef- fects of climate change and the associated political and social discussions may lead to greater demand for investment prod- ucts that take into account climate -related and environmental risks or make a contribution to climate protection.
977;DekaBank_Deutsche_Girozentrale_2022_EN;88;0;;;;;;;;;;;Imple mentation and results of risk driver analysis/risk in- ventory and stress testing The group -wide assessment of the significance of climate and environmental risks as part of the sustainability risks is carried out as part of the annual risk inventory. The in fluence of cli- mate and environmental risk drivers on the main risk types is analysed. ( CF. CHAPTER 6.3.1.
978;DekaBank_Deutsche_Girozentrale_2022_EN;88;1;;;;;;;;;;;) With regard to the perspective of up to five years considered in the risk inventor y, it can be stated that the climate and envi- ronmental risk drivers for the established material risk types are predominantly classified as not significant. With regard to busi- ness risk, transitory climate and environmental risks can repre- sent significant drivers under stressed assumptions, regardless of the probability of occurrence of such events and develop- ments.
979;DekaBank_Deutsche_Girozentrale_2022_EN;88;1;;;;;;;;;;;In addition, it should be noted for operational risks that the significance of transitory climate and environmental risks will increase in the future in view of growing portfolios in products with sustainability features in connection with the in- crease in regulatory requirements. Within the scope of the risk inventory, climate stress scenarios specific to risk types were developed in order to b e able to shed light on risk -type-specific vulnerabilities in detail.
980;DekaBank_Deutsche_Girozentrale_2022_EN;88;1;;;;;;;;;;;Thus, with regard to credit risk, probabilities of default and loss rates of business partners from potentially affected country -industry combinations were specifically stressed. The res ult supports the statement made above that climate -related and environmental risks currently have no significant impact on DekaBank's risk profile, even under stressed conditions.
981;DekaBank_Deutsche_Girozentrale_2022_EN;88;1;;;;;;;;;;;Based on the climate stress scenarios specified by the ECB, cli- mate -related risks (transitory and physical) were quantified for DekaBank's portfolio in the year under review. The result shows only a slight change in the risk profile, which confirms the res ilience of the Deka Group's business model to climate - related and environmental risks.
982;DekaBank_Deutsche_Girozentrale_2022_EN;88;1;;;;;;;;;;;Within the framework of macroeconomic stress testing, effects are determined for an observation period of three years, but developments that only become relevant in the medium to long term are already brought forward via scenario parameter- isation. This indirect approach, in which the impact of future effects on the current portfolio are taken into account, enables an initial examination of the impact of long -term effects on the current portfolio.
983;DekaBank_Deutsche_Girozentrale_2022_EN;88;1;;;;;;;;;;;"AMW business division Specific securities -related climate and environmental risks for the business segment are analysed as part of the annual risk inventory. Climate -related scenarios are not yet applied. As part of the Net Zero implementation, a Investor Climate Action Plan is being prepared, which considers the management of climate -related and environmental risks in investor portfolios in its sub -section ""Investment""."
984;DekaBank_Deutsche_Girozentrale_2022_EN;88;1;;;;;;;;;;;The results from this and from overarching strategic portfolio analyses will provide the AMW business divisio n with further starting points for climate -related and environmental opportunities and risks.
985;DekaBank_Deutsche_Girozentrale_2022_EN;89;0;;;;;;;;;;; Table of contents 89 Climate and Environmental risk s Strategy Reporting AMI business division In order to take into account the special features of the real es- tate asset class, in particular the lower fungibility, further time horizons are taken into account in the AMI business division.
986;DekaBank_Deutsche_Girozentrale_2022_EN;89;0;;;;;;;;;;;Thus, three to five years are considered as the short -term time horizon for concrete actio n planning, while the medium -term time horizon, which is relevant for investment planning, covers a period of ten years. Long -term time horizons of more than ten years are particularly relevant for the analysis of the effects of climate change on the prope rties and the strategies derived from this for dealing with physical and transitory risks.
987;DekaBank_Deutsche_Girozentrale_2022_EN;89;0;;;;;;;;;;;The re- sults of the analyses can lead, for example, to updated coun- tries of investment, changed types of real estate use or an ad- justed business field strategy. The focus of the business division's climate -related measures is currently on the medium -term time horizon.
988;DekaBank_Deutsche_Girozentrale_2022_EN;89;0;;;;;;;;;;;The specific busi- ness environment analysis, which follows the annual risk man- agement process, comes to the conclusion that there are no significant cli mate and environmental risks for the real estate sector for the time horizon of three years. It must be taken into account that there are opportunities both in the short term, e.g.
989;DekaBank_Deutsche_Girozentrale_2022_EN;89;0;;;;;;;;;;;through concrete measures to improve energy effi- ciency of properties, and i n the medium term, within the framework of investment planning, to reduce the effects of cli- mate change on the properties or the effects of the properties on climate change. 6.2.2.
990;DekaBank_Deutsche_Girozentrale_2022_EN;89;0;;;;;;;;;;;Dealing with the impact of climate and environ- mental risks and opportunities on t he Deka Group Both at DekaBank level and in the AMW and AMI business di- visions, numerous approaches are already being taken to sys- tematically deal with the impacts of climate and environmental risks and opportunities. The range of measures implemented by DekaBank extends from the integration of climate -related and environmental aspects into the ESG scorecards ( CF. CHAP- TER 4.1.2.
991;DekaBank_Deutsche_Girozentrale_2022_EN;89;0;;;;;;;;;;;), which are taken into account as part of the lend- ing process, t o the consideration of corresponding aspects in the due diligence processes for the acquisition or sale of equity investments, to the definition of climate and environmental re- quirements in the sustainability declaration that the largest suppliers must sig n before entering into a business relation- ship.
992;DekaBank_Deutsche_Girozentrale_2022_EN;89;0;;;;;;;;;;;AMW business division In the AMW business division, climate and environmental risks are comprehensively considered in the investment process. For example, in the course of implementing the Disclosure Regula- tion, limits are set for the Principal Adverse Impact (PAI) indica- tor on greenhouse gas (GHG) intensity.
993;DekaBank_Deutsche_Girozentrale_2022_EN;89;1;;;;;;;;;;;In order to identify and assess climate -related and environmental risks that are not re- flected in the available ESG ratings from external providers, the AMW business division uses a specific risk level model for the investment process, which incorporates analyses of climate and environmental risks from its own ESG research as well as other external sources. The model is used to classify the cli- mate and en vironmental risk exposure of individual issuers.
994;DekaBank_Deutsche_Girozentrale_2022_EN;89;1;;;;;;;;;;;In the course of pursuing the goals from the aforementioned signing of the NZAM as well as taking into account the limits for the PAI indicator on GHG intensity, the AMW business divi- sion aims to successiv ely decarbonise the portfolios, e.g. through specific Net Zero products, which can reduce climate and environmental risks for the value and performance of the funds.
995;DekaBank_Deutsche_Girozentrale_2022_EN;89;1;;;;;;;;;;;The interim targets up to 2030 defined within the framework of the NZAM relate to the se lf-managed mutual funds that are managed in accordance with Net Zero. The strategy for achiev- ing the NZAM targets is based on four pillars: 1. As part of intensifying dialogues (engagement) with the is- suers with the highest GHG emissions in the portfolios, th e business division will work towards them setting science - based targets to comply with the 1.
996;DekaBank_Deutsche_Girozentrale_2022_EN;89;1;;;;;;;;;;;5° Celsius limit under the Paris Climate Agreement by 2030 at the latest. The re- sponse and progress of the companies will be monitored by ESG analysts and followe d up in dialogue with the com- panies. 2. The AMW business division aims to work more with inves- tors to design new fund products with a 1.5° Celsius strat- egy from the outset. 3.
997;DekaBank_Deutsche_Girozentrale_2022_EN;89;1;;;;;;;;;;;Portfolio managers are provided with additional climate -re- lated and environmental information, on the basis of which the issuers' climate strategy, GHG intensity of production and other climate -relevant data can be comprehensively as- sessed and taken into account in portfolio management. 4.
998;DekaBank_Deutsche_Girozentrale_2022_EN;89;1;;;;;;;;;;;External asset managers, with whom the AMW business di- vision works to implement their investment products, are encouraged to observe the Net Zero target when manag- ing Deka funds and to commit themselves to achieving Net Zero targets as part of the initiati ves brought together un- der the umbrella of the Glasgow Financial Alliance for Net Zero (GFANZ).
999;DekaBank_Deutsche_Girozentrale_2022_EN;90;0;;;;;;;;;;; Table of contents 90 Climate and Environmental risk s Strategy Reporting AMI business division The long -term framework for the activities in the AMI business division is the aspiration to achieve climate neutrality in the real estate portfolio by 2050 at the latest. By aligning with the Paris climate goals, the main aim is to reduce the potential im- pact of transitory risks.
1000;DekaBank_Deutsche_Girozentrale_2022_EN;90;0;;;;;;;;;;;In order to achieve this goal, numerous measures are being implemented in the property portfolio to improve energy efficiency. These include the development of a photovoltaic strategy, the goal of which is to be able to in- creasingly use energy from photovoltaic systems in commercial properties in the future. On the other hand, the current and forecast CO 2 emissions of properties are taken into account in investment decisions.
1001;DekaBank_Deutsche_Girozentrale_2022_EN;90;0;;;;;;;;;;;An important basis for the analysis and evaluation of the spe- cific emissions of individual properties is the Carbon Risk Real Estate Monitor (CRREM). This science -based tool provides in- formation on the maximum energy consumption and CO 2 emissions at certain points in time in order to achieve the Paris climate goals, taking into account various variables such as the type of use of a prop erty and its location.
1002;DekaBank_Deutsche_Girozentrale_2022_EN;90;0;;;;;;;;;;;These CRREM target paths are continuously adapted by the research project to cur- rent developments and improved data bases. 6.2.3. Resilience of the strategy to climate and environ- mental risks Based on selected scenarios specified by the Eu ropean Central Bank (ECB), DekaBank quantified the impact of climate and environmental risks on its loan portfolio during the year under review.
1003;DekaBank_Deutsche_Girozentrale_2022_EN;90;0;;;;;;;;;;;The result shows only a moderate impact on both the utilisation of risk -bearing capacity and the core tier 1 ca pital ratio, which confirms the resilience of the Deka Group's busi- ness model to climate and environmental risks. In this context, stress testing also serves the resilience of the strategy to climate and environmental risks. ( CF. CHAPTER 6.2.1. ) The internal stress testing programme is continuously being developed.
1004;DekaBank_Deutsche_Girozentrale_2022_EN;90;0;;;;;;;;;;;The scenarios used currently cover both physical and transitory risks. The scenarios used in stress test- ing were also developed taking into account the scenarios published by the Network for Greening the Financial System (NGFS) and the ECB stress test on climate and environmental risks. In order to provide an initial examination of the long -term ef- fects of climate and environment al risks, the indirect approach described above was used in the macroeconomic stress test- ing.
1005;DekaBank_Deutsche_Girozentrale_2022_EN;90;1;;;;;;;;;;;No significant effects were identified for the current port- folio and the analysed climate -related and environmental risk aspects. In addition, risk -type-specific climate stress scenarios were carried out in order to shed more light on risk -type-spe- cific vulnerabilities. Thus, with regard to credit risk, probabili- ties of default and loss rates of business partners from the po- tentially affected portfolio segment (cou ntries and industries) were specifically stressed.
1006;DekaBank_Deutsche_Girozentrale_2022_EN;90;1;;;;;;;;;;;The result supports the statement made above that climate and environmental risks currently have no significant impact on the Deka Group's risk profile, even under stressed conditions. Background: The Glasgow Financial Alliance for Net Zero (GFANZ) The Glasgow Financial Alliance for Net Zero (GFANZ) is the world's largest coalition of fin ancial institutions committed to decarbonising the economy and achieving Net Zero GHG emissions by 2050 at the latest.
1007;DekaBank_Deutsche_Girozentrale_2022_EN;90;1;;;;;;;;;;;Members currently include around 550 banks, insurance companies, asset managers and other financial service providers that are members of at least one sector -specific Net Zero alliance, such as NZAM. The GFANZ was launched in April 2021 by the UN Special Representative for Climate Policy and Finance and the COP26 Presidency in partnership with the UNFCCC Race to Zero campaign to coordinate efforts across all sectors of the financial system to accelerate the transition to a Net Zero economy.
1008;DekaBank_Deutsche_Girozentrale_2022_EN;90;1;;;;;;;;;;;All members of the Alliance commit to achieving Net Zero GHG emissions by 2050 at the latest, have also set interim targets for 2030 and report regularl y on their progress. Further information on the GFANZ: www.gfanzero.
1009;DekaBank_Deutsche_Girozentrale_2022_EN;90;1;;;;;;;;;;;com Climate strategy of the Deka Group As part of a group -wide project, the Deka Group's existing comprehensive strategic climate activities in the business divisions and corporate centres are to be systematically brought together to form a holistic climate strategy for the Deka Group. The group -wide climate strategy to be formulated on this basis aims to further develop the Deka Group's positioning in the topic area of climate in a holis- tic, efficient and competitive manner.
1010;DekaBank_Deutsche_Girozentrale_2022_EN;90;1;;;;;;;;;;;With this integrative orientation of the project, the ex- panded, climate -related demands, needs and expectations of the shareholders, customers and stakeholders are to be met in the best possible way. This includes – in addition to a climate - and environment -friendly design of the product and service offering – comprehensive transparency about the handling of climate - and environment -related ambi- tions, goals, oppo rtunities and risks in the Deka Group.
1011;DekaBank_Deutsche_Girozentrale_2022_EN;90;1;;;;;;;;;;;Such transparency provides stakeholders and rating agen- cies with a sound basis for analysing and evaluating the Deka Group's climate and environmental commitment.
1012;DekaBank_Deutsche_Girozentrale_2022_EN;90;1;;;;;;;;;;;In addition, the extended political and regulatory req uire- ments, for example from European and German climate legislation, from the regulatory expectations of the ECB and BaFin on dealing with climate -related and environ- mental risks, and the consideration of new reporting standards, such as those formulated i n the Corporate Sus- tainability Reporting Directive (CSRD), are integrated.

Risk management – Climate aspects in the risk management system 6.3.1. Processes for identifying and assessing climate and environmental risks The Deka Group pursues various interrelated approaches to identifying and assessing climate and environmental risks. In addition to the business environment analysis already de- scribed ( CF. CHAPTER 6.2.1.
1014;DekaBank_Deutsche_Girozentrale_2022_EN;91;0;;;;;;;;;;;), this includes in particular the risk driver analysis, which is carried out annually as part of the risk inventory. Definition and delimitation of climate and environmen- tal risks In order to ensure a uniform understanding of sustainability risks throughout the Deka Group, these risks are clearly de- fined and classified within the framework of the risk taxon- omy.
1015;DekaBank_Deutsche_Girozentrale_2022_EN;91;0;;;;;;;;;;;Due to their macroeconomic significance and regulatory focus, the analys is focuses on climate and environmental risks as a particular aspect of sustainability risks.
1016;DekaBank_Deutsche_Girozentrale_2022_EN;91;0;;;;;;;;;;;For DekaBank, cli- mate and environmental risks are part of sustainability risks and describe the risk that business activities with points of con- tact with the area s of climate and the environment could lead to developments or events that result in a deterioration in capi- tal resources or liquidity, either directly through the bank's own business operations or indirectly through customers and business partners.
1017;DekaBank_Deutsche_Girozentrale_2022_EN;91;0;;;;;;;;;;;In acc ordance with the ECB Guide on Cli- mate and Environmental Risks, DekaBank considers climate and environmental risks together in this context and distin- guishes between physical, transitory and other climate and en- vironmental risks. (CF. CHAPTER 6.2.1. and TABLE 28 ) For the Deka Group, climate and environmental risks are drivers of the established risk types that require special attent ion due to their significance.
1018;DekaBank_Deutsche_Girozentrale_2022_EN;91;1;;;;;;;;;;;They are generally viewed in the context of the relevant risk types and not as a separate risk type.

1021;DekaBank_Deutsche_Girozentrale_2022_EN;91;1;;;;;;;;;;;In principle, a distinction can be made between direct effects on DekaBank and its business operat ions (direct effects) and effects via business activities, such as lending busi- ness or outsourced services (indirect effects). Depending on the severity of climate and environmental risks, systemic ef- fects may also occur, for example effects on the stabili ty of the financial market, which may affect all market participants.
1022;DekaBank_Deutsche_Girozentrale_2022_EN;91;1;;;;;;;;;;;As a result, DekaBank may be affected by such risks and their im- pact without itself being affected directly or indirectly via its customers. In the case of climate and environmental risk s, it is therefore useful to distinguish between local and suprare- gional events and market -wide or sector -specific effects. DekaBank's specific exposure therefore depends, among other things, on the current portfolio, the macroeconomic environ- ment and the specific climate and environmental event.
1023;DekaBank_Deutsche_Girozentrale_2022_EN;91;1;;;;;;;;;;;In ad- dition, the respective period under consideration must be taken into account. For example, as climate change pro- gresses, an increase in the number of weather events and their intensity can be expected. While an intensification of political initiatives can also be expected with an increase in negative impacts of climate events, it can be assumed that premiums will rise or that these events will not be insurable with regard to insurance cover.
1024;DekaBank_Deutsche_Girozentrale_2022_EN;91;1;;;;;;;;;;;As a result, impac ts can change via the transmission channels and also intensify in terms of their im- pact. Risk management process in the AMW and AMI business divisions At the level of the capital management company (Kapital- verwaltungsgesellschaft, KVG), th e AMW and AMI busi- ness divisions follow DekaBank's risk management pro- cess.
1025;DekaBank_Deutsche_Girozentrale_2022_EN;91;1;;;;;;;;;;;As part of the annual risk inventory described above, the specific climate and environmental risks at KVG level are analysed for the respective business division. Climate and envir onmental risks at investment fund level are also considered drivers of the main risk types, in particular mar- ket price risk, liquidity risk and counterparty risk.
1026;DekaBank_Deutsche_Girozentrale_2022_EN;91;1;;;;;;;;;;;The ap- propriate handling of these investment -related (AMW) and real estate -related (AMI) clim ate and environmental risks is ensured by various KVG -specific measures in the in- vestment process as well as in the KVG's own risk control- ling.
1027;DekaBank_Deutsche_Girozentrale_2022_EN;92;0;;;;;;;;;;; Table of contents 92 Climate and Environmental risk s Risk management Reporting Risk driver analysis For a detailed examination of climate and environmental risks, a catalogue of climate and environmental risk drivers was de- veloped, describing the fundamental impact chains and trans- mission channels on market participants as well as the Deka Group's business operations and activities.
1028;DekaBank_Deutsche_Girozentrale_2022_EN;92;0;;;;;;;;;;;The aim of t he risk driver analysis is to identify significant risk drivers for the Deka Group and thus to create transparency regarding business model -specific vulnerabilities. To achieve this goal, the risk driver analysis involves a detailed and risk -type-specific analysis of climate -related and environmental risk drivers with regard to the portfolio, the established material risk types and all of the bank's business activities.
1029;DekaBank_Deutsche_Girozentrale_2022_EN;92;0;;;;;;;;;;;In this way, the question can be answered for each material risk type as to whether and which risk drivers have a significant influence on this risk type. In order to take into account risk type -specific characteristics, different impact mechanisms and differentiated data availabil- ity, a risk type -specific approach is pursued within the frame- work of the risk driver analysis.
1030;DekaBank_Deutsche_Girozentrale_2022_EN;92;0;;;;;;;;;;;For each risk type, it is first a n- alysed which risk drivers can occur in the observation horizon due to business activities and risk landscape. For these risk drivers, a detailed analysis is carried out regarding the signifi- cance, i.e. the intensity of the effect on the respective risk ty pe when it occurs. Thresholds specific to the type of risk are gen- erally used for this purpose.
1031;DekaBank_Deutsche_Girozentrale_2022_EN;92;0;;;;;;;;;;;The analysis is largely carried out within the framework of a top -down analysis or portfolio anal- ysis and is supplemented by bottom -up analyses in the sense of individual case observations. Both internal and external data are used for the analyses and supplemented by expert esti- mates. (CF. TABLE 29 ) The observation horizon for the analysis is current ly at least five years.
1032;DekaBank_Deutsche_Girozentrale_2022_EN;92;0;;;;;;;;;;;In the time horizon under consideration, the climate and envi- ronmental risk drivers for the established material risk types are predominantly classified as not significant. With regard to busi- ness risk, transitory climate and environmental risks can repre- sent significant drivers under stressed assumptions, regardless of the probability of occurrence of such events and develop- ments.
1033;DekaBank_Deutsche_Girozentrale_2022_EN;92;0;;;;;;;;;;;In addition, it should be noted for operational risks that the significance of transitory climate and environmental risks will increase in the future in view of growing portfolios in products with sustainability features in connection with the in- crease in regulatory requirements.

Processes for managing climate and environmen- tal risks Based on the findings from the risk driver analysis, climate and environmental risks are successi vely integrated into the risk control instruments for their management.
1038;DekaBank_Deutsche_Girozentrale_2022_EN;93;0;;;;;;;;;;;Due to the mecha- nisms of action specific to the types of risk, risk -type-specific approaches to the management of climate and environmental risks are used in addition to cross -risk-type guidelines and guard rails. For example, climate and environmental risks as drivers of counterparty risk within the Deka Group are limited by numer- ous procedures and qualitative guard rails, such as negative lists and minimum standards for financing.
1039;DekaBank_Deutsche_Girozentrale_2022_EN;93;0;;;;;;;;;;;ES G scorecards are used in the credit approval process to assess the risks associ- ated with ESG factors. (CF. CHAPTER 4.1.2. ) In addition, with a view to climate -related and environmental risks as drivers of market price risks, a sustainability filter for proprietary invest-ments and exclusion criteria within the framework of the col- lateral pol icy, i.e. specifications on securities collateral ac- cepted, are used.
1040;DekaBank_Deutsche_Girozentrale_2022_EN;93;0;;;;;;;;;;;ESG scorecards ESG scorecards are used to identify credit activities that re- act sensitively to climate and environmental risks. In these, physical and transitory climate risks, labour a nd human rights criteria as well as governance aspects are considered on a segment -specific basis. The assessment is based on an ESG traffic light logic with a classification of the financ- ing or the borrower with low to high ESG risks. A high risk classifi cation generally leads to rejection. (CF.
1041;DekaBank_Deutsche_Girozentrale_2022_EN;93;0;;;;;;;;;;;CHAPTER 4.1.2. ) 6.3.3.
1042;DekaBank_Deutsche_Girozentrale_2022_EN;93;1;;;;;;;;;;;Processes for integrating climate and environmen- tal risks into general risk management The management of climate -related and environmental risks as drivers of operational risks takes various forms: Physical risks for the Deka Group's own locations and the locations of major service providers are mitigated through regular and systematic analy ses of precautionary measures for the respective service locations and, if necessary, coordination and testing of coun- termeasures.
1043;DekaBank_Deutsche_Girozentrale_2022_EN;93;1;;;;;;;;;;;Transitory risks are countered in particular with systematic control processes in order to be able to react to the dynamics o f intensifying regulatory developments and to en- sure compliance with voluntary commitments, such as the vol- untary commitment by German savings banks to climate - friendly and sustainable business practices or the Poseidon Principles (CF. CHAPTER 4.1.2.3. ).
1044;DekaBank_Deutsche_Girozentrale_2022_EN;93;1;;;;;;;;;;;In order to ensure appropri- ate resources, continuous training and recruitment of suitable employees is carried out. Climate and environmental risks as drivers of liquidity risks are effectively managed for relevant asset and liability positions through various instruments.
1045;DekaBank_Deutsche_Girozentrale_2022_EN;93;1;;;;;;;;;;;Thus, the potential effects of cli- mate and environmental risks, such as the unexpected with- drawal of refinancing funds, market value discounts on (highly) liquid se curities or the increase in collateral requirements, are systematically taken into account in various stressed liquidity maturity statements.
1046;DekaBank_Deutsche_Girozentrale_2022_EN;93;1;;;;;;;;;;;In addition, the liquidity position is moni- tored on an ongoing basis and forward planning is carried out with the help of various instruments, such as intraday liquidity management and balance monitoring. The analyses of the risk inventory in the year under review have shown, as described, that the effects of climate and envi- ronmental risks are predominantly classifi ed as not significant in the time horizon considered for the main risk types.
1047;DekaBank_Deutsche_Girozentrale_2022_EN;93;1;;;;;;;;;;;Against this background, there is no separate limitation of climate and environmental risks as part of the sustainability risks within the framework of the risk -bearing capacity calculation. In the fu- ture, suitable performance and risk indicators will be selected Application example of the risk driver analysis: liquidity risk The following application example explains the procedure for risk driver analysis based on liquidity risk.
1048;DekaBank_Deutsche_Girozentrale_2022_EN;93;1;;;;;;;;;;;In principle, climate -related and environmental risks can influence the liquidity situation through reduced liquidity inflows, in- creased liquidity ou tflows and/or reduced liquidity poten- tial. Due to the increased impact of physical climate and environmental risks on short -term liquidity, these are ini- tially the focus of the analysis. Data from an external provider is used to assess the refi- nancing’s e xposure to physical risk drivers.
1049;DekaBank_Deutsche_Girozentrale_2022_EN;93;2;;;;;;;;;;;This data con- tains risk indicators for physical climate -related and envi- ronmental risk drivers. A threshold is then defined for each driver. Based on this threshold, it is derived whether the refinancing source is affected by the respective event. On the asset side, securities in particular can be affected. If their market value or the repayment amount falls due to climate and environmental events, this leads to reduced li- quidity potential.
1050;DekaBank_Deutsche_Girozentrale_2022_EN;93;2;;;;;;;;;;;In addition to securities, on the assets side overnight and term deposits as well as loans can po- tentially contribute to a significant deterioration of the li- quidity situation if there are reduced repayments or a de- fault on repayment due to climate and environmental risks.
1051;DekaBank_Deutsche_Girozentrale_2022_EN;93;2;;;;;;;;;;;In order to qu antify the effects of climate and environ- mental risks on securities, the relevant counterparties for bonds and shares are evaluated analogously to the market price risk with a climate -related risk indicator from an ex- ternal data provider, the Climate Value at Risk (VaR). For each risk driver, the specific liquidity outflows are deter- mined on the basis of the data for both the assets and the liabilities side.
1052;DekaBank_Deutsche_Girozentrale_2022_EN;93;2;;;;;;;;;;;To determine the significance of physical risk drivers, these liquidity outflows for the respective driv- ers are compared to the materiality threshold for liquidity risks and any significance is derived.

1054;DekaBank_Deutsche_Girozentrale_2022_EN;94;0;;;;;;;;;;;AMW and AMI business divisions Responsibility for managing risks and identifying opportunities in the management of portfolios lies with the respective port- folio managers in the AMW and AMI business divisions. This also includes responsibility for climate and environmental risks and opportunities.
1055;DekaBank_Deutsche_Girozentrale_2022_EN;94;0;;;;;;;;;;;By providing comprehensive information on climate and environmental risks and opportunities of portfolios and issuers, the portfolio managers are supported in the best possib le way in fulfilling this responsibility. In principle, the transformation to a low -carbon economy can have both a negative and a positive impact on the financial performance of the product range of the AMW and AMI busi- ness divisions.
1056;DekaBank_Deutsche_Girozentrale_2022_EN;94;0;;;;;;;;;;;This depends on vari ous factors, for example, in the case of equity portfolios, in which sectors and countries the companies operate, in whose shares the fund invests, and how the individual companies deal with the challenges of the transition. The same applies to the transit ion of real estate in AMI's special assets.
1057;DekaBank_Deutsche_Girozentrale_2022_EN;94;0;;;;;;;;;;;The comprehensive consideration of the relevant factors on an economic and business level requires a profound understanding of the effects of the transition as well as extensive and resilient data. On this basis, investment strate- gies can be adjusted as necessary. The AMW and AMI business divisions are continuously working to improve the scope and quality of the required information.
1058;DekaBank_Deutsche_Girozentrale_2022_EN;94;0;;;;;;;;;;;In the investment process in the AMW business division, cli- mate -related and envi ronmental criteria are taken into account in particular through fund -specific, fund group -specific and general exclusions, the integration of corresponding criteria in the target fund selection process, the definition of specific in- vestment universes for f unds and other products with sustaina- bility features, and the use of specific research, e.g. on the cli- mate risk management of individual issuers.
1059;DekaBank_Deutsche_Girozentrale_2022_EN;94;0;;;;;;;;;;;For real estate, the property -specific transition and the respective physical risks are particularly relevant . The portfolio managers receive compre- hensive training in order to be able to include climate and en- vironmental risks in portfolio management on the basis of their respective sector expertise. In addition, uniform standards for the consideration of climat e risks in portfolio management are to be developed as part of the development of the climate strategy.
1060;DekaBank_Deutsche_Girozentrale_2022_EN;94;0;;;;;;;;;;;Within the framework of risk controlling, climate and environ- mental risks are integrated into the methods and processes as follows: ■ In the launch pro cess of the mutual and special funds, it is ensured that climate -related and environmental require- ments can be monitored. This includes in particular the mon- itoring of exclusions, limits and other investment limits as well as the controlling of market pric e, liquidity or credit risk.
1061;DekaBank_Deutsche_Girozentrale_2022_EN;94;0;;;;;;;;;;;In addition, the assessment of other risks from climate and environmental aspects, in particular reputational risks, is car- ried out, especially in the case of mutual funds. As a result of the audits, changes or adjustments to t he product or pro- cesses can be made if necessary. ■ Within the scope of the investment limit check, the KVG - wide, fund group -specific and fund -specific climate -related or environmental restrictions such as exclusions or limits are monitored.
1062;DekaBank_Deutsche_Girozentrale_2022_EN;94;1;;;;;;;;;;;On the one hand , this takes into account the dif- ferent risk needs and sustainability preferences of investors and investor groups, and on the other hand, it addresses reputational risks at the KVG level or implements regulatory requirements. ■ In the counterparty risk, ass essments of climate and environ- mental risks are incorporated qualitatively into the overall as- sessment of the default risk. There is a close exchange be- tween the relevant specialised units.
1063;DekaBank_Deutsche_Girozentrale_2022_EN;94;1;;;;;;;;;;;■ In the market price risk of AMW's products, climate and en- vironmen tal risks are taken into account within the frame- work of market price risk stress tests. The focus is thus placed on ad hoc events, as measurable effects on relevant market parameters have historically mainly been observed when extreme events occur. Long -term developments have no noticeable effects in the regular controlling processes or are already priced in.
1064;DekaBank_Deutsche_Girozentrale_2022_EN;94;1;;;;;;;;;;;The amount of the discounts in the stress tests is derived from historical events. In the AMI busi- ness division, these are mapped using product -speci fic meth- ods, e.g. Monte Carlo simulation for direct property funds and scoring models for credit and property funds of funds.
1065;DekaBank_Deutsche_Girozentrale_2022_EN;94;1;;;;;;;;;;;■ In the liquidity risk of AMW's products, climate and environ- mental risks are taken into account analogously to the mar- ket price ri sk within the scope of liquidity risk stress tests, whereby both the liquidity of the investments and the liquid- ity requirements of the investors are taken into account.
1066;DekaBank_Deutsche_Girozentrale_2022_EN;94;1;;;;;;;;;;;■ The climate and environmental risks of AMI's products are monitored and managed in an integrated manner in the ex- isting risk system of the investment funds or, if this is indi- cated on a product -specific basis, added via suitable second- ary models. Transitory and physical risks are measured and limited in the real estate risk model, for examp le.
1067;DekaBank_Deutsche_Girozentrale_2022_EN;94;1;;;;;;;;;;;In terms of content, current and future issues are quantitatively meas- ured in the model in comparison to the so -called CRREM model and physical risks based on risk events as well as property characteristics. In addition, the stress tests have also been expanded to include such scenarios. In addition, Risk Controlling regularly describes risk interactions between the main risk types (counterparty, market price, li- quidity and operational risk).
1068;DekaBank_Deutsche_Girozentrale_2022_EN;94;1;;;;;;;;;;;The analysis is carried out via chains of effects between ri sk sub -types. The climate or envi- ronmental risk affects the main risk types via the risk sub - types.

Metrics & Targets – Climate -related indicators and targets The further development of the strategic climate measures with regard to the defined targets, for example the fulfilment of the obligation arising from the signing of the NZAM, re- quires a systematic inventory of the greenhouse gas emissions (GHG emissions) associated with the Deka Group's business activities.
1070;DekaBank_Deutsche_Girozentrale_2022_EN;95;0;;;;;;;;;;;The GHG emissions currently recorded for the Deka Group's business divisions are presented below. The further improvement of the data situation, taking into account the specific challenges of the indiv idual business divisions and the requirements of the Greenhouse Gas Protocol (GHG Protocol), is one of the priorities for 2023.
1071;DekaBank_Deutsche_Girozentrale_2022_EN;95;0;;;;;;;;;;;Financing business division In the business division of financing, various approaches are currently being pursued, with which the GHG emissions for the various financings (financed emissions) and other meaning- ful key figures on the climate and environmental quality of the financings can be recorded and associated risks identified. The diversity of the financing sectors and indivi dual financings poses a challenge.
1072;DekaBank_Deutsche_Girozentrale_2022_EN;95;0;;;;;;;;;;;The following examples provide an over- view of the range of indicators used in this context. Transport financing In the area of transport finance, with a focus on the financing of ships and aircraft, reliable data on the associated Scope 1 emissions is already available, which is mainly provided by ex- ternal service providers such as Marsoft and Cirium. As of 31 Decem ber 2022, the total Scope 1 CO 2 emissions financed on this basis were 3.11 million tonnes ( CF.

1074;DekaBank_Deutsche_Girozentrale_2022_EN;95;0;;;;;;;;;;;94 After DekaBank joined the Poseidon Principles Initiative in 2022, the CO 2 data for the ship financing portfolio will also be provided directly by customers as part of the Poseidon Princi- ples reporting, so that the scope and quality of the data basis for calculating the financed emissions will also improve here. It should be noted that ships with a deadweight tonnage of less than 5,000 tonnes and ships under construction are not taken into account.
1075;DekaBank_Deutsche_Girozentrale_2022_EN;95;0;;;;;;;;;;;In its first year of joining the Poseidon Principles, DekaBank achieved a Climate Alignment Score of 5.2 percent, putting it in an above -average position compared with other signatory financial institutions. In the aircraft financing portfolio, the CO 2 figures are based on real data of the respective financed aircraft.
1076;DekaBank_Deutsche_Girozentrale_2022_EN;95;1;;;;;;;;;;;Infrastructure and export finance portfolio In infrastructure and export financing, the financing of renew- able energies is important with regard to climate and environ- mental risks and opportunities, which is why its volume is con- tinuously recorded separately. Work is currently underway to define mea ningful key figures for other sub -portfolios of infra- structure and export finance, e.g. the financing of public utili- ties and transport companies.
1077;DekaBank_Deutsche_Girozentrale_2022_EN;95;1;;;;;;;;;;;As of 31 December 2022, fi- nancing for renewable energies reached a gross volume of 1.43 billion euros ( CF. TABLE 31 ): GROSS FINANCING VOLUME FOR RENEWABLE ENERGIES (TABLE 31) 31 Dec 2021 31 Dec 2022 Gross financing volume of renewable energies (billion euros) 1.43 1.
1078;DekaBank_Deutsche_Girozentrale_2022_EN;95;1;;;;;;;;;;;43 Real estate financing portfolio In the case of property financing, building certification with a recognised sustainability certificate allows conclusions to be drawn about climate -related and environmental quality, as en- ergy efficiency, for example, is a key assessmen t criterion here. The Deka Group therefore attaches great importance to the appropriate certification of the properties it finances, with a focus on commercial properties.
1079;DekaBank_Deutsche_Girozentrale_2022_EN;95;1;;;;;;;;;;;As of 31 December 2022, a total of 69 percent of the properties financed in new busi ness had been awarded such a certificate. ( CF. TABLE 32 ) Data on the CO 2 footprint of individual properties is currently only Climate and environmental indicators for the Deka Group's business operations As in previous years, the environmental indicat ors for the Deka Group's business operations, including GHG emis- sions, energy and water consumption, transport and waste, can be found in CHAPTER 3.2.
1080;DekaBank_Deutsche_Girozentrale_2022_EN;95;1;;;;;;;;;;;The GHG emissions from business operations are calculated using the VfU tool, which is a globally recogni sed standard for the ac- counting of operational environmental indicators for fi- nancial institutions.

1083;DekaBank_Deutsche_Girozentrale_2022_EN;96;0;;;;;;;;;;;SHARE OF GHG -INTENSIVE SECTORS IN DEKABANK'S LENDING VOLUME (TABLE 33) Share of lending volume (as of 31 Dec 2022) gross net* Financial sector 46% 39% State -affiliated and supranational institutions 15% 24% Funds (transactions / shares) 11% 13% Real estate sector (incl.

1085;DekaBank_Deutsche_Girozentrale_2022_EN;96;0;;;;;;;;;;;It can be seen that, for strategic reasons, the majority of the Deka Group's lending activities are outside CO 2-intensive sec- tors, primarily in the financial sector and with public -sector counterparties. Exposures in sectors with a fundamentally higher CO 2 intensity essentially relate to the real estate sector, the transport sector and conventional energies & infrastruc- ture.
1086;DekaBank_Deutsche_Girozentrale_2022_EN;96;0;;;;;;;;;;;Activities in the real estate sector (9 percent of the gross lend- ing volume) are associated with low physical and transitory risks overall due to risk strategy guidelines – in particular the focus on portfolio financing, the exclusion of speculative real estate financing, systematic attention to third -party usability as well as location factors, low residual terms and the availability of insurance.
1087;DekaBank_Deutsche_Girozentrale_2022_EN;96;0;;;;;;;;;;;For exposures in the transport sector (3 percent of the gross lending volume), transitory risks are also mitigated by appropri- ate standards, for example by me eting valid minimum environ- mental standards, observing marketability and third -party usa- bility, as well as specifications on remaining useful life at the end of the loan term.
1088;DekaBank_Deutsche_Girozentrale_2022_EN;96;0;;;;;;;;;;;"Exposures in the category of ""Conventional energies & infra- structure"" (3 perce nt of the gross lending volume) are mainly related to public basic suppliers, but also to a small extent to gas-fired power plants, whose risk is largely borne by fixed power purchase agreements with utilities with public sector shareholders. Furthermore, here too, no financing is concluded that poses significant risks to the climate and the environment."
1089;DekaBank_Deutsche_Girozentrale_2022_EN;96;0;;;;;;;;;;;AMW business division In order to record climate -related and environmental risks in the manag ed securities portfolios, the AMW business division is working on the definition and introduction of various key figures. Important starting points here are the requirements of the Disclosure Regulation and the NZAM voluntary commit- ment.
1090;DekaBank_Deutsche_Girozentrale_2022_EN;96;0;;;;;;;;;;;"As part of the NZA M initiative, the Scope 1 and 2 emis- sions for the initially committed portfolio are collected using the key figure ""Weighted Average Carbon Intensity"" (WACI). It describes the weighted average carbon intensity of a portfo- lio by setting the GHG emissions of a company, in which a fund invests in relation to the company's turnover. The calcu- lated GHG emission figure for the company is then multiplied by the share that the investment has in the overall portfolio."
1091;DekaBank_Deutsche_Girozentrale_2022_EN;96;0;;;;;;;;;;;The result provides information on whether a por tfolio invests in companies with a higher or lower GHG intensity compared to other portfolios or to an appropriate benchmark overall. The WACI is thus an important indicator both for concrete in- vestment decisions for individual companies and for the man- agement of portfolios.
1092;DekaBank_Deutsche_Girozentrale_2022_EN;96;0;;;;;;;;;;;The year 2019 was determined as the base year here, from which the data will be collected and doc- umented annually in order to form a historical time series and to be able to manage the development of emissions intensity of relevant po rtfolios in line withNZAM targets.

Taking into account th e current method and data coverage, 27 percent of the AMW product portfolio – over 200 fund products – are thus managed compatibly with a 1.5° Celsius path.
1096;DekaBank_Deutsche_Girozentrale_2022_EN;97;0;;;;;;;;;;;In 2022, the relevant key figures were deter- mined for the included portfolios. Based on this, the b usiness area will monitor these key figures every six months and use them as part of the NZAM initiative to manage decarbonisa- tion. The goal is to reduce the WACI for the included portfo- lios by 50 percent by 2030.
1097;DekaBank_Deutsche_Girozentrale_2022_EN;97;0;;;;;;;;;;;At the same time, the coverage of currentl y 37 percent of the volume of assets under manage- ment will be successively increased and should include all port- folios under management by 2050 at the latest.
1098;DekaBank_Deutsche_Girozentrale_2022_EN;97;0;;;;;;;;;;;As part of the implementation of the requirements from the Disclosure Regulation and the NZAM m embership, further cli- mate and environmental criteria, for example the CO 2 foot- print (carbon footprint), are to be included in the relevant pub- lications at product level in addition to the WACI. In addition, the respective key figures are expected to be pu blished in ag- gregated form for all securities in the portfolio on the respec- tive KVG website from 30 June 2023.
1099;DekaBank_Deutsche_Girozentrale_2022_EN;97;0;;;;;;;;;;;AMI business division In the AMI business division, the CO 2 footprint of the invest- ment assets held in trust has already been recorded since 2019. The challenge in recording consumption data for an in- ternational portfolio lies in the lack of uniform European and international standards for recording and calculatin g corre- sponding key figures.
1100;DekaBank_Deutsche_Girozentrale_2022_EN;97;0;;;;;;;;;;;For this reason, one focus of activities in the AMI business division is on the ongoing improvement of the quality of the consumption and emissions data collected for the properties. To this end, internal standards for recordin g and processing were further refined and harmonised during the reporting period.
1101;DekaBank_Deutsche_Girozentrale_2022_EN;97;0;;;;;;;;;;;Through working groups in the German Investment and Asset Management Association (Bundesver - band Investment und Asset Management, BVI) and the Ger- man Property Federation (Zen traler Immobilienausschuss e. V., ZIA), work is also being done to establish a uniform under- standing across the sector so that the data collected and re- ported will also be binding, comparable and transparent exter- nally in the future.
1102;DekaBank_Deutsche_Girozentrale_2022_EN;97;0;;;;;;;;;;;As a result of these e fforts, it can be seen that the annual fluctuations in CO 2 emission values are de- creasing, which can be seen as an indicator of the increasing informative value of the key figures. On this basis, reliable an- nual comparisons of the indicators are possible. As in previous reporting, the consumption data recorded basi- cally cover the energy consumption from the previous year, in this case from 2021. The measures to reduce CO 2 emissions are showing initial success.
1103;DekaBank_Deutsche_Girozentrale_2022_EN;97;1;;;;;;;;;;;The CO 2 emissions associated with the propert ies in the real estate portfolios were reduced from a total of 525,628 tonnes in 2020 to 475,000 tonnes in 2021. Of these, around 331,000 tonnes were attributable to mutual funds and around 144,000 tonnes to special funds. ( CF. FIG- URE 8 ) In relative terms, 45.6 kg/m² CO 2 (2020: 52.5 kg/m²) were generated in the mutual funds and 37.0 kg/m² (2020: 44.7 kg/m²) in the special funds.
1104;DekaBank_Deutsche_Girozentrale_2022_EN;97;1;;;;;;;;;;;Reasons for this positive development are first successes of the energy efficiency strategy, the use of green electricity and, last but not least, the targeted purchase of energy -efficient build- ings with the simultaneous sale of less efficient buildings. Fur- thermore, the effects of the Corona pandemic and the associ- ated lower use of commercial properties are noticeable.
1105;DekaBank_Deutsche_Girozentrale_2022_EN;97;1;;;;;;;;;;;The collected data form the basis for the development of spe- cific, science -based reduction paths as well as for the definition of suitable measures to achieve them. In doing so, country - specific require ments as well as particularities of the respective types of use of the properties are taken into account.
1106;DekaBank_Deutsche_Girozentrale_2022_EN;97;1;;;;;;;;;;;Consideration of Principal Adverse Impacts (PAI) An analysis of climate -related aspects also takes place within the framework of the assessment of the most significant ad- verse sustainability impacts (Principal Adverse Impacts, PAI) for real estate prescribed by the Disclosure Regulation, for which metrics are defined. This includes, on the one hand, the share of investments in real esta te related to the extraction, storage, transport or production of fossil fuels.
1107;DekaBank_Deutsche_Girozentrale_2022_EN;97;1;;;;;;;;;;;The investment share of the properties in the real estate portfolios that is actively in- volved in the extraction, storage, transport or production of fossil fuels for consumpti on or consumption by third parties is recorded. This share will be reported from 2023 onwards. Secondly, the PAI calculates the proportion of investments in properties with poor energy efficiency.
1108;DekaBank_Deutsche_Girozentrale_2022_EN;97;2;;;;;;;;;;;"For this purpose, the market value -weighted share of prope rty values with poor en- ergy efficiency is recorded in relation to all market values of property values in the portfolio that are obligatory for compli- ance with the regulations for the preparation of Energy Perfor- mance Certificates (EPC) or for ""Nearly Zero Energy Buildings"" (NZEB).

The finance industry is assigned the central functio n by politicians and regulators to steer capital flows into sustainable investments and to ensure a high level of market transparency.
1114;DekaBank_Deutsche_Girozentrale_2022_EN;100;0;;;;;;;;;;;"In order to create clarity and legal certainty as to what constitutes a sustainable investment, the EU Commission created an EU -wide classification system of sustainable eco- nomic activities with Regulation (EU) 2020/852 (hereinafter re- ferred to as the ""Taxonomy Regulation""). According to this Taxonomy Regulation, around 100 economic activities in 13 sectors are to be evaluat ed in terms of their impact on the cli- mate and the environment."
1115;DekaBank_Deutsche_Girozentrale_2022_EN;100;0;;;;;;;;;;;In particular, the EU taxonomy also includes a catalogue of concrete technical requirements that an economic activity must fulfil in order to be classified as compliant with the taxonomy. The regulation entered into force in July 2020. On 10 Decem- ber 2021, the European Commission published a Delegated Act (EU) 2021/2178 in the Official Journal of the EU, which specifies the reporting obligations of the various actors in the financial market, including those of financial institutions.
1116;DekaBank_Deutsche_Girozentrale_2022_EN;100;0;;;;;;;;;;;Re- porting obligations according to the Taxonomy Regulation ap- ply to all (non -)financial undertakings that are obliged to sub- mit a non -financial statement according to the Accounting Di- rective 2013/34/EU.

The legal act entered into force in August 2022 and is also taken into account in the following explanations."
1118;DekaBank_Deutsche_Girozentrale_2022_EN;100;0;;;;;;;;;;;Under Article 8 of the Taxonomy Regulation, the Dek a Group is also required to classify relevant business using defined as- sessment criteria. For the 2022 year under review, the Deka Group's business was therefore analysed with regard to its tax- onomy eligibility. This indicates the proportion of the busines s volume in relevant economic activities and sectors that is, in principle, to be subject to a future taxonomy compliance re- view.
1119;DekaBank_Deutsche_Girozentrale_2022_EN;100;0;;;;;;;;;;;The key figures in TABLE 34, which were determined within the framework of the requirements of the Regulation, are par- ticular ly important taking into account I. the Deka Group's integrated business model as the Wertpapierhaus for the savings banks, with its focus on as- set management business and the II. geographical as well as systemic limits of the EU Taxonomy Regulation.
1120;DekaBank_Deutsche_Girozentrale_2022_EN;100;0;;;;;;;;;;;The Deka Group's business model as an end -to-end solutions provider is designed to address the needs of savings banks and their customers and to provide all the necessary asset manage- ment and banking services for the securities business of the savings banks and their customers. As a partner, the Deka Group also provides targeted sales support. The core business consists of the provision of customer -ori- ented securities and real estate investments ( CF. CHAPTER 4.1.1.
1121;DekaBank_Deutsche_Girozentrale_2022_EN;100;1;;;;;;;;;;;Sustainability in capital investment). In this context, fi- nancing is to be classified as a complementary service along the entire value chain of asset investment and management (CF. CHAPTER 4.1.2. Sustainability in lending). Through the Financing business division, which focuses on spe- cial and real estate finance, the Deka Group supports the sav- ings banks in refinancing.
1122;DekaBank_Deutsche_Girozentrale_2022_EN;100;1;;;;;;;;;;;Furthermore, ne w business activities focus on loans that can be placed and serve as an attractive in- vestment for institutional investors. The Financing business di- vision is equally weighted alongside Strategic Investments in Treasury as the long -term component of the Dek a Group's as- set side and is therefore the investment vehicle for business ac- tivities on the liabilities side.
1123;DekaBank_Deutsche_Girozentrale_2022_EN;100;1;;;;;;;;;;;Financing is both transferred to the bank's own balance sheet in the banking book and passed on as investment products in the form of club deals, syndica- tions or fund units. In addition, participation in loans arranged by third parties is possible.
1124;DekaBank_Deutsche_Girozentrale_2022_EN;100;1;;;;;;;;;;;The Special Finance sub -division focuses on financing energy, grid, utility, transport and social infrastructure projects (infra- structure financing and renewable energy financing), aircraft, ships and rail transport (transport financing), financing covered by export credit agencies (ECA) and public sector financing. The Real Estate Financing sub -division offers financing for commercial real estate in the office, logistics, retail and hotel sectors.
1125;DekaBank_Deutsche_Girozentrale_2022_EN;100;1;;;;;;;;;;;The focus is on marketable properties in relevant mar- kets due to their size, transparency and liquidity. The Taxonomy Regulation aims to define environmentally sus- tainable activities by providing companies, th e financial sector and policy makers with the definitions as to which economic activities can be considered environmentally sustainable.
1126;DekaBank_Deutsche_Girozentrale_2022_EN;101;0;;;;;;;;;;;" Table of contents 101 within the framework of Article 8 of the Taxonomy Regulation Eligibility Reporting 202 2 Reporting The delegated acts (""Climate Delegated Act"" Annex I and II) of the Taxonomy Regulation d escribetaxonomy eligible economic activities. However, these include property financing for private individuals (private construction financing or retail business), which is not part of the Deka Group's business model."
1127;DekaBank_Deutsche_Girozentrale_2022_EN;101;0;;;;;;;;;;;Furthermore, according to the regul ation, no special and real estate financing outside the European Economic Area (EEA) may be included, even if the economic activity (intended use) can be considered environmentally sustainable. This also ap- plies to the same extent to so -called special purp ose vehicles (SPVs) inside and outside the EEA, regardless of the location and taxonomy eligibility of the financing object.
1128;DekaBank_Deutsche_Girozentrale_2022_EN;101;0;;;;;;;;;;;In the sub - business area of real estate financing, Europe, the United King- dom and North America are the preferred markets. However, financings outside the EEA, i.e. the United Kingdom and North America, may not be reported in KPI No. 1, irrespective of their taxonomy eligibility within the meaning of the EU Regulation. Aircraft financing is generally not considered taxonomy eligi- ble.
1129;DekaBank_Deutsche_Girozentrale_2022_EN;101;0;;;;;;;;;;;An environmentally sustainable or taxonomy -compliant eco- nomic activity is an economic activity that fulfils the require- ments laid down in Article 3 of the Taxonomy Regulation by ■ making a significant contribution to at least one of the six environmental ob jectives (Art. 3a, Taxonomy Regulation), ■ not causing significant harm to the other environmental ob- jectives (Do no significant harm (DNSH) criteria) (Art. 3b, Taxonomy Regulation) and ■ meeting the minimum social safeguards (Art.
1130;DekaBank_Deutsche_Girozentrale_2022_EN;101;0;;;;;;;;;;;3c, Taxonomy Regulation). The basis for the application are the delegated acts for the supplementary definition of the technical assessment criteria, which the EU Commission has adopted pursuant to Article 23 of the Taxonomy Regulation (Annex I for environmental objec- tive 1 and Ann ex II for environmental objective 2) or will adopt (environmental objectives 3 to 6) (Art. 3d, Taxonomy Regula- tion).
1131;DekaBank_Deutsche_Girozentrale_2022_EN;101;0;;;;;;;;;;;The analysis of the taxonomy eligibility carried out is therefore to be understood on the one hand as an intermediate step in the reporting, and on the other hand it corresponds to full compliance with the current regulatory requirements pursuant to Article 8 of the delegated act until the full requirements pursuant to Article 10 of the same act enter into force.
1132;DekaBank_Deutsche_Girozentrale_2022_EN;101;0;;;;;;;;;;;"From the 2023 year under review and when the full scope of reporting comes into force, the Deka Group is required to pub- lish the Green Asset Ratio (hereinafter also referred to as ""GAR""). This key figure indicates the ratio of taxonomy -com- pliant transactions to a defined por tion of the bank's assets (so-called ""covered assets"", see below for details)."
1133;DekaBank_Deutsche_Girozentrale_2022_EN;101;0;;;;;;;;;;;"Only with the publication of the Green Asset Ratio can a statement be made as to whether the transactions can be described as sus- tainable in the sense of the EU Taxonomy Regulat ion.

It shows the share of taxonomy eligible risk positions (gross carrying amounts) that are to be subjected to an audit for taxonomy compliance as of the year under review 2023. For KPI No.
1141;DekaBank_Deutsche_Girozentrale_2022_EN;102;1;;;;;;;;;;;1, loans, debt securities and equity instruments against entities subject to the Non Financial Repo rting Directive (NFRD) (both financial corporations, non -financial corporations and other financial corporations) as well as households and lo- cal authorities (municipalities and local authorities, whose pur- pose is the financing of public housing or special financing) are to be analysed for taxonomy eligibility.
1142;DekaBank_Deutsche_Girozentrale_2022_EN;102;1;;;;;;;;;;;The decisive factor for taxonomy eligibility is the economic ac- tivity of the respective financing. To check the taxonomy eligi- bility of the relevant risk positions, the financings were first an- alysed for directly derivable economic activities. If a non -taxon- omy eligible economic activity exists, it is recorded in KPI No. 2. Risk positions without directly attributable economic activity, i.e. without intended use, were included in KPI No.
1143;DekaBank_Deutsche_Girozentrale_2022_EN;102;1;;;;;;;;;;;1 for the first time as of the year under review in the amount of the tax- onomy eligibility ratio published by the respective companies. In the previous year, corresponding information from compa- nies was not yet available and was therefore reported in KPI No. 2. Compa rability with the previous year’s data is therefore limited.
1144;DekaBank_Deutsche_Girozentrale_2022_EN;102;1;;;;;;;;;;;For non -financial companies, the taxonomy eligibility ratios were used for the first time on the basis of both sales revenue 26 Capital Expenditures (CapEx) (turnover) and capital expenditure (CapEx). If information from the c ompanies is not yet available or not yet published as of the reporting date, the Deka Group has classified these risk positions entirely as non -taxonomy eligible, as in the previous year, and allocated them to KPI No.
1145;DekaBank_Deutsche_Girozentrale_2022_EN;102;2;;;;;;;;;;;2 together with the non - taxonomy eligi ble portions of the gross exposures. As of the reporting date, the Deka Group did not finance any taxonomy eligible economic activities in the area of nuclear en- ergy. Taxonomy eligible activities in connection with the con- struction or operation of facilit ies for the generation of elec- tricity or heat from fossil gaseous fuels were taken into ac- count in the amount of 0.01 percent in relation to total assets in KPI No. 1.
1146;DekaBank_Deutsche_Girozentrale_2022_EN;102;2;;;;;;;;;;;Exposures to companies that are not subject to NFRD are excluded from the taxonomy eligi bility test and are reported in KPI No. 5 (24.0 percent of total assets, 2021: 28.4 percent). Companies are not subject to the NFRD obligation if they do not have their legal seat in the EEA or are exempt from the obligation to prepare non -financial report ing due to their size.
1147;DekaBank_Deutsche_Girozentrale_2022_EN;102;2;;;;;;;;;;;The assessment of the NFRD obligation was deter- mined on the basis of a negative delimitation to small or me- dium -sized enterprises (SMEs). Other risk positions that cannot be classified as taxonomy eligi- ble by definition are assigned to KPI No. 3, No. 4, No. 6 and No. 7. They are not in line with the product and customer groups relevant for the taxonomy and can therefore not be in- cluded in KPI No. 1 and KPI No. 2. Their share in total assets is 48.8 percent (2021: 49.8 percent).

KPI No. 4 shows the share of assets from derivatives. Since KPI No. 3 and KPI No. 4 each also include trading book positions, which are also recorded in KPI No . 6, the sum of the KPIs deviates from 100 percent.
1149;DekaBank_Deutsche_Girozentrale_2022_EN;103;0;;;;;;;;;;;Supplementary voluntary quantitative data For the mandatory reporting of the share of taxonomy eligible assets (KPI No. 1), only risk positions against customers that are obligated to non -financial repo rting (NFRD obligation) were taken into account. The assessment of the NFRD obliga- tion for customers domiciled in the EEA was determined on the basis of a negative differentiation from small and medium - sized enterprises (SMEs).
1150;DekaBank_Deutsche_Girozentrale_2022_EN;103;0;;;;;;;;;;;This can, for example, also involve fi- nancing of so -called special purpose vehicles (SPVs), the pur- pose of which is to be classified as taxonomy eligible. If the taxonomy eligible exposures of these customers were taken into account in KPI No. 1, this turnover -based KPI No. 1a would increase by 4.1 percentage points (in relation to total assets) to 11.5 percent or by 6.4 percentage points in relation to covered assets to 17.9 percent. CapEx -based KPI No. 1b would increase to 12.
1151;DekaBank_Deutsche_Girozentrale_2022_EN;103;1;;;;;;;;;;;0 percent (based on total assets) and 18.6 percent (based on covered assets), while KPI No. 5 would decrease accordingly to 20 percent.

1153;DekaBank_Deutsche_Girozentrale_2022_EN;103;1;;;;;;;;;;;It is one of the first signatories of the “Self -commi tment by German Savings Banks to climate - friendly and sustainable business practices” and thus manifests its stance in the form of a corporate assumption of responsibil- ity for society in achieving global climate targets. In this con- text, the realisation of regulatory requirements is carried out from the joint perspective of customer and regulator. ( CF. CHAPTER 2.2.
1154;DekaBank_Deutsche_Girozentrale_2022_EN;103;1;;;;;;;;;;;) The Taxonomy Regulation also results in corre- sponding requirements that are coordinated and implemented within the Deka Group. Through its diverse activities across different business divisions, the Deka Group contributes to the promotion of sustainable business activities in the EU as well as their transparency and comparability. Taxonomy -compliant products and product strategies are already available today.
1155;DekaBank_Deutsche_Girozentrale_2022_EN;103;1;;;;;;;;;;;The market -driven ex- pansion of the range of products with sustainability features during the year under review and the efforts in lending busi- ness to support customers in future, who incorporate climate risks into their busine ss model and contribute to the imple- mentation of the goals of the Paris Climate Agreement (“transformation financing”) are just two examples of the on- going development of the product and service range.
1156;DekaBank_Deutsche_Girozentrale_2022_EN;103;1;;;;;;;;;;;This also includes initiatives to support the strategy of the parties in- volved (particularly the operators of the financed assets) on the path to increasing sustainability in the areas of ecology, social affairs and corporate governance. As an active investor, the Deka Group consistently engages in dialogue w ith investors, companies and issuers in order to support them closely in the steps they take to achieve their sustainability goals, in coordi- nation with its own guard rails. ( CF.
1157;DekaBank_Deutsche_Girozentrale_2022_EN;103;1;;;;;;;;;;;CHAPTER 4.1. ) This is supported by the ongoing development of internal gov- ernance structures and processes. In order to meet the Deka Group’s holistic focus on sustainability while taking into ac- count new regulatory requirements, the ESG governance tar- get, which enco mpasses the entire Deka Group, has been es- tablished at organisational and instrumental level since 2022. (CF. CHAPTER 2.2.3.
1158;DekaBank_Deutsche_Girozentrale_2022_EN;103;2;;;;;;;;;;;) The successive integration of ESG issues into line processes en sures that relevant informati on can be in- corporated into the business model on an ongoing basis. It can be assumed that with the full implementation of the tax- onomy, expanded information will be available that will signifi- cantly increase the transparency of the sustainability of busi- ness partners and their activities.
1159;DekaBank_Deutsche_Girozentrale_2022_EN;103;2;;;;;;;;;;;Impulses generated from this will be continuously taken up and considered in the further de- velopment of the business model. In addition to the Taxonomy Regulation, the Disclosure Regula- tion 2019/2088, which came into force on 10 March 2021, is also an essential measure within the framework of the EU Ac- tion Plan on Financing Sustainable Growth. The Disclosure Regulation transpos es the requirements of the European Sus- tainable Finance Disclosure Regulation (SFDR) into national law.
1160;DekaBank_Deutsche_Girozentrale_2022_EN;103;2;;;;;;;;;;;This regulates the disclosure obligations of financial ser- vice providers with regard to the consideration of sustainability issues in their strategies, processes and products.

1162;DekaBank_Deutsche_Girozentrale_2022_EN;105;0;;;;;;;;;;; Table of contents 105 About the report For the 2022 year under review, DekaBank complies with the provisions of the “Act to Strengthen Non -Financial Reporting by Companies in their Management and Group Management Reports” (CSR Directive Implementation Act) in conjunction with the provisions in Sections 289 and 315 of the German Comme rcial Code (Handelsgesetzbuch, HGB) by preparing a joint non -financial report for the Deka Group (the Deka Group includes DekaBank Deutsche Girozentrale as the.

1165;DekaBank_Deutsche_Girozentrale_2022_EN;105;0;;;;;;;;;;;Taking into account the principle of materiality, the non -financial rep ort focuses on these companies insofar as they make a significant contribu- tion to the Deka Group’s sustainability performance. The fol- lowing companies are to be considered: bevestor GmbH, Deka Immobilien Investment GmbH, Deka International S.A., Deka Inves tment GmbH, Deka Vermögensmanagement GmbH, IQAM Invest GmbH, S Broker AG & Co. KG, and WestInvest Gesellschaft für Investmentfonds mbH.
1166;DekaBank_Deutsche_Girozentrale_2022_EN;105;0;;;;;;;;;;;Unless otherwise stated, the information in this report relates to the Deka Group. Individual key figures in the area of envi- ronmental management relate to individual locations. Where this is the case, this is noted. Unless otherwise stated, all information in the sustainability re- porting relates to the reporting period from 1 January 2022 to 31 December 2022. Thus, the reporting period of the sustaina- bility reporting corresponds to that of the financial reporting.
1167;DekaBank_Deutsche_Girozentrale_2022_EN;105;0;;;;;;;;;;;The Deka Group sees itself as an organisation that is focused on customer benefit across all levels and divisions and uses the strengths of its integrated bus iness model, which is based on asset management as well as banking business, to this end. Compliance with reporting standards The Sustainability Report complies with the guidelines of the Global Reporting Initiative (GRI) in the current version “GRI Stand ards”.
1168;DekaBank_Deutsche_Girozentrale_2022_EN;105;0;;;;;;;;;;;The GRI is regarded as the globally recognised guideline for sustainability reporting. The Deka Group declares that it has taken the greatest possible care in preparing this re- port and that, to the best of its knowledge, the information contained in this report is correct and no material circum- stances have been omitted. All information in the report gen- erally relates to the calendar year 2022. Where this is not the case, this is noted accordingly. (CF. GRI Content Index at www.deka.
1169;DekaBank_Deutsche_Girozentrale_2022_EN;105;1;;;;;;;;;;;de/deka -group ) Content requirements of the CSR Directive Implementa- tion Act (CSR -RUG) Section 289c of the German Commercial Code defines the contents of the non -financia l report. In addition to describing the company’s business model, the non -financial report should also refer at least to the aspects listed below if these are mate- rial for understanding the course of business and the impact of the company’s own corporate a ctivities.
1170;DekaBank_Deutsche_Girozentrale_2022_EN;105;1;;;;;;;;;;;In essence, these are the same aspects that the Deka Group undertook to take into account comprehensively when signing the UN Global Com- pact. The significance of the five aspects for the Deka Group (“internal view”) is presented below.
1171;DekaBank_Deutsche_Girozentrale_2022_EN;105;1;;;;;;;;;;;In addit ion to these aspects required by the CSR -RUG, the Deka Group reports in this Sustainability Report 2022 on fur- ther objectives and measures that specific target groups of the report, in particular sustainability rating agencies, consider ma- terial for unders tanding the Deka Group’s sustainability -related commitment and impact on employees, the environment and society.
1172;DekaBank_Deutsche_Girozentrale_2022_EN;105;1;;;;;;;;;;;This takes into account the fact that individual sustain- ability rating agencies only use publicly available sources of in- formation for their as sessments, in particular sustainability re- ports or non -financial reports. Environmental issues Environmental issues are relevant to the Deka Group in various contexts. One of these is the consideration of environmental criteria in financing.
1173;DekaBank_Deutsche_Girozentrale_2022_EN;105;1;;;;;;;;;;;Here, non -compliance with environmental standards, for example in the case of infrastructure projects, can lead to delays in the completion of the projects and there- fore possibly to delays or even defaults in servicing the financ- ing, as well as to reputational damage. Such risks can be mini- mised by observing international standards, e.g. the Equator Principles. These aspects are discussed in chapters 4.1.2. “Sus- tainability in lending” and 5.1. “Regulations and standards”.
1174;DekaBank_Deutsche_Girozentrale_2022_EN;105;2;;;;;;;;;;;Secondly, from the Deka Group’s perspective, it is also im- portant to minimise the direct impact of its activities on the en- vironment. The targets and measures for this area are docu- mented in chapter 3. “Sustainable banking operations”. Not least as a result of the recommendations of the TCFD and the EC B in their guidance on managing climate and environ- mental risks, the risks of climate change have become even more important for the financial sector.
1175;DekaBank_Deutsche_Girozentrale_2022_EN;105;2;;;;;;;;;;;The Deka Group has therefore summarised the relevant information and data on dealing with climate and env ironmental risks in the new chap- ter 6 and has based this on the TCFD’s recommendations on the structure and content of corresponding reporting.
1176;DekaBank_Deutsche_Girozentrale_2022_EN;106;0;;;;;;;;;;; Table of contents 106 About the report Employee issues Employees are the foundation of the Deka Group’s business activities. In this context, it is particularly important – also against the backdrop of demographic change – to recruit and retain employees in the numbers and with the qualifications required to provide the services. At the same time, from the employees’ point of view, it is essential to ensure their profes- sional and health -related employability through appropriate measures.
1177;DekaBank_Deutsche_Girozentrale_2022_EN;106;0;;;;;;;;;;;"The Deka Group’s efforts in areas such as training and further education, promoting equal opportunities and oc- cupational he alth and safety are discussed in chapter 4.2. “Employees – Sustainable human resources management"". DekaBank falls within the scope of application of the Act on Corporate Due Diligence in Supply Chains (Lieferkettensorg- faltspflichtengesetz, LkSG), which w ill come into full force on 1 January 2023."
1178;DekaBank_Deutsche_Girozentrale_2022_EN;106;0;;;;;;;;;;;As part of the implementation of the legal re- quirements, various measures were already carried out in the year under review, which are reported on in chapter 3.1.2. Social issues Promoting development at local and regional level and sup- porting local authorities in fulfilling their tasks in the economic, regional, social and cultural spheres is enshrined in the Savings Banks Act and therefore also guides the Deka Group's actions. Its extensive social activities a re described in chapter 4.3.
1179;DekaBank_Deutsche_Girozentrale_2022_EN;106;0;;;;;;;;;;;"""So- cial commitment"". Respect for human rights Respect for human rights is important in the banking sector, especially in connection with the financing of infrastructure projects. This often involves dealings with local communities. By taking the Equator Principles into account in corresponding financi ng, DekaBank ensures that human rights aspects are taken into account in the financing."
1180;DekaBank_Deutsche_Girozentrale_2022_EN;106;0;;;;;;;;;;;On the one hand, this is intended to avoid risks both for the implementation of the projects and for the DekaBank's reputation. Secondly, negative impacts on the people affected by the financed projects should be excluded as far as possible. The UK Modern Slavery Act of 2015 also refers to the respon- sibility of companies to eliminate slave labour in the supply chain.
1181;DekaBank_Deutsche_Girozentrale_2022_EN;106;1;;;;;;;;;;;"It obliges all companies doing business in the UK to make a declaration of what measures they have taken to en- sure that there is no ""slave labour"" in their supply chain. The Deka Group is also required to make such a declaration based on its business activities in the UK. It is published on the Deka Group's website. Further information on these topics can be found in chapters 3.1.2. ""Procurement"", 4.1.2. ""Sustainability in lending"" and 5.1. ""Regulations and standards""."
1182;DekaBank_Deutsche_Girozentrale_2022_EN;106;1;;;;;;;;;;;"Combating corruption and bribery Compliance with legal and regulatory requirements with re- gard to combating corruption and bribery is one of the basic requirements of responsible corporate governance. Violations of these standards regularly lead to legal – including financial – sanctions and a loss of reputation. The Deka Group's corre- sponding guidelines and measures for combating corruption and bribery are documented in chapter 5.2.1. ""Compliance""."
1183;DekaBank_Deutsche_Girozentrale_2022_EN;106;1;;;;;;;;;;;With regard to the risks associated with non -financial aspects, it should be noted that all significant risks are intensively dis- cussed in the Risk Management Committee and reported to the Board of Management and the relevant supervisory bodies.
