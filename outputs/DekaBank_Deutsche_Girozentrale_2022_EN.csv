Foreword Dear Ladies and Gentlemen, at this time, we are faced with enormous challenges as well as opportunities in Germany and in Europe. Firstly, Russia's war of aggression on Ukraine worries and unsettles us all. The escalation of violence and threat to a peaceful country pose a serious challenge to European security. It is now more important than ever that the global community works closely together to achieve a peaceful solution and protect the Eu- ropean continent.

In addition, inflation is leading to rising prices in these months and is affecting many people in Germany.

The past year has made it clear to us in Germany that, in addi- tion to the outlined challenges, climate change is also advanc- ing. Climate change continues to be one of the most pressing problems of our time and requires a swift and decisive re- sponse. It is clear to all of us that we must act urgently to pre- serve the planet for future generations.

The energy crisis is the dominant issue in Europe. Germany has been hit particularly hard because of its high dependence on Russian gas.
