achievement of global sustainability goals. By financing renewable energy, for example, we are contributing towards SDG 7, which 
seeks to ensure access to affordable"

Our net zero commitment – i.e. the promise to reduce our carbon 
footprint to"
26;Commerzbank_2022_EN-2;2;9;;;;;"net zero – is a key example of how we as a financial 
intermediary drive sustainability. We follow binding rules for dealing with environmental and social risks, which we 
continuously review and adapt as necessary. We have a clear 
stance"
27;Commerzbank_2022_EN-2;2;10;;;;;"on controversial topics such as fossil fuels, arms and mining. In the ESG framework th at was published in 2022, we 
disclose all the key building blocks  of our sustainability strategy 
and transparently explain how we manage sustainability in"
28;Commerzbank_2022_EN-2;2;11;;;;;"our core business. A transparent and fair approach towards our 
customers is one of the keys to doing business sustainably. 
Treating our employees responsibly – even and especially at times of great upheaval and economic challenges – is another. "
29;Commerzbank_2022_EN-2;2;12;;;;;"
In the following, we ex plain in detail how we specifically fulfil 
our responsibility towards th e environment and society and 
towards our customers and workforce, what successes we 
achieved in the year under review  (see chart “Milestones in"
30;Commerzbank_2022_EN-2;2;13;;;;;"2022”) 
and what we are still working on. We outline what matters to us and what we stand for. In order to make our progress in the 
individual areas visible, we regu larly collect strategic KPIs (key 
performance indicators) and"
31;Commerzbank_2022_EN-2;2;14;;;;;"other key figures. 
Our sustainability rating and ranking results and our inclusion 
in the relevant indices also demonstrate that we are on the right 
track. In 2022, major rating agen cies for sustainability gave 
Commerzbank Aktiengesellschaft ra tings that were"
32;Commerzbank_2022_EN-2;2;15;;;;;"mainly above 
the sector average. For example, Sustainalytics gives us a 
“medium risk” rating. In addition, we continue to be listed in sustainability indices such as FTSE4Good. An overview of the 
ratings and our awards can be found in our"
33;Commerzbank_2022_EN-2;2;16;;;;;"Sustainability 
Factsheet, which is published online and constantly updated. 
Our subsidiaries also perform well in this respect: MSCI ESG 
rated mBank as “A” during the year under review, while 
Sustainalytics assessed mBank’s risk profile as “low”. mBank is also listed"

that are moving into th e focus of the sustainability debate, such as 
biodiversity protection and a resource-conserving circular economy. We will have to find strategic solutions to these issues in 
conjunction with our customers. 
 
 
 
Our commitment"

by our voluntary undertakings. For example, we were one of the

Managing climate and biodiversity risks  
At Commerzbank, we"

type of risk, but as a horizontal risk. This can materialise across 
the different known types of risk . In 2022, we again carried out 
a comprehensive materiality analysis for climate risks"

risk types for the Commerzbank Group, in particular with regard to 
the expectations set out in the ECB’s guidance on climate and 
environmental risks. In this process, all risk types assessed as 
material in the risk inventory are"
212;Commerzbank_2022_EN-2;12;20;;;;;"evaluated in terms of their 
materiality in relation to climat e risks, and both transition and 
physical risks are taken into consideration. Transition risks arise 
for companies, for example, as a result of regulatory or legal 
changes in energy policy,"
213;Commerzbank_2022_EN-2;12;21;;;;;"changes in market sentiment and preferences, or technological innovations. Physical risks, on the

Reducing operational emissions 
Commerzbank 
Aktiengesell-
schaft has had an ISO 14001-
certified 
environmental management system in place ever since 2009. In 
2015, we added an energy manage ment system certified"
395;Commerzbank_2022_EN-2;21;5;;;;;"to ISO 
50001, establishing an integrat ed environmental and energy 
management system (iUEMS).  
This defines the responsibilities, behaviour, processes and 
specifications for the implementation of the operational 
environmental and energy policy and documents them in a structured manner. The"
396;Commerzbank_2022_EN-2;21;6;;;;;"focus is on optimising resource 
consumption, particularly where we can have a direct impact on 
the environment, such as in building management and business trips. 
 
 
 
First and foremost, the iUEMS serves to continuously improve 
our own environmental"
397;Commerzbank_2022_EN-2;21;7;;;;;"and energy performance. At the same 
time, it helps minimise risk: by regularly observing and checking the current situation, any need for action can be id entified at an 
early stage and preventive measures can be taken. This integrated 
management"
398;Commerzbank_2022_EN-2;21;8;;;;;"system forms an ideal basis for ensuring the business has a sustainable orientation. 
We can achieve savings in our operational emissions through 
efficient and sustainable building management in particular, and we are taking various measures to achieve this. These include"
399;Commerzbank_2022_EN-2;21;9;;;;;"
gradually replacing conventional light sources with LEDs since 
2017, making a significant contri bution to energy saving.  We continuously review the energy efficiency of our buildings

in reducing the electricity consumption"

401;Commerzbank_2022_EN-2;21;11;;;;;"in further buildings. 
In addition, special attention is paid to making travel activities 
as environmentally friendly as possible and thus preventing CO

emissions. The business travel policy therefore envisages rail as 
the preferred means of transport. This also means avoiding"
402;Commerzbank_2022_EN-2;21;12;;;;;"air

464;Commerzbank_2022_EN-2;25;1;;;;;"recent years the measures designed to promote a good work-life balance have been 
further improved to open up fresh career opportunities for women 
in particular. These include company childcare, innovative part-time models – including for managers – and structured return-to-
work"
465;Commerzbank_2022_EN-2;25;2;;;;;"options to prevent careers from stalling. 
These measures have enabled Commerzbank to increase the 
proportion of women in leadersh ip positions to more than 30% 
Group-wide over the past few years. Our Board of Managing 
Directors has set a new"
466;Commerzbank_2022_EN-2;25;3;;;;;"goal of 40% across all management levels (management levels 1–4 and level-5 project managers) by the end

explicitly tasked with actively  approaching suitable female 
employees during the recruitment process."
467;Commerzbank_2022_EN-2;25;4;;;;;"The Bank therefore 
launched dedicated projects in 2022, putting diversity and 
inclusion on the strategic issues agenda. For example, one Risk Management initiative focused on equality, mental health and 
internationalism under the banner “Colourful Group Risk 
Management”. Group Services also"
468;Commerzbank_2022_EN-2;25;5;;;;;"celebrated the lived diversity of its workforce through the “COO.bunt” (COO.colourful) 
campaign. The aim is to further in crease the proportion of female 
candidates for management positions when filling new positions. That is why the task of identifying, retaining and"
469;Commerzbank_2022_EN-2;25;6;;;;;"developing talent 
and high performers has been written into the HR strategy 
guidelines. In addition, all areas within the Board of Managing Directors have set their own equali ty targets, which together add 
up to a target of 40% of"
470;Commerzbank_2022_EN-2;25;7;;;;;"management positions held by women by 
2030.  
Key figure: At the end of 2022, 35.0% of management 
positions across the Group were held by women. 
 
 Driving inclusion 
The inclusion of people with disabilities is another part of"
471;Commerzbank_2022_EN-2;25;8;;;;;"our 
diversity strategy. Barrier-free access to the workplace and to 
working tools is just as high a priority as the implementation of 
accessibility in our digital offerings for customers. Commerzbank 
Aktiengesellschaft has consistently exceeded the statutory requirement of 5% employees"
472;Commerzbank_2022_EN-2;25;9;;;;;"with disabilities in recent years. We 
met this quota again in 2022 (5.9%).  
We are now devoting more attention to the next generation: in 
2022 we advertised for the first time on myAbility, a job platform 
for people with"
473;Commerzbank_2022_EN-2;25;10;;;;;"disabilities that aims to further promote diversity 
and inclusion. 
Treating each other with respect 
Commerzbank Aktiengesellschaft is committed to an op en approach in 
respect of the sexual orientation 
and gender identity of its staff, customers and business contacts. 
This"
474;Commerzbank_2022_EN-2;25;11;;;;;"is achieved through education and various formats for 
dialogue, such as digital events and communication about queer people. Formats covering the topics  of coming out, subconscious 
reservations and overarching diversity issues such as families and 
cross-cultural understanding are particularly"
475;Commerzbank_2022_EN-2;25;12;;;;;"popular with employees. These are also regularly attended by members of the 
Board of Managing Directors and executives.  
We want to embrace diversity in our language as well, so we 
decided in April 2022 to launch  a one-year"
476;Commerzbank_2022_EN-2;25;13;;;;;"pilot with a 
recommendation on inclusive lang uage. We are initially gathering 
experience with this recommendation in internal publications, with the aim of communicating in a more accessible, value-neutral

Through publication of the “Prout Performer” lists, the"

Compliance risks are identified and managed across all compliance risk types as part of  the compliance programme that 
has been put in place"

the programme include a regular Group-wide compliance risk analysis, internal safeguards, and controls to assess the adequacy

Responsibilities of Management 
Management of the parent company is responsible for the preparation of the combined separate non-financial report in

adopted thereunder as set out"
577;Commerzbank_2022_EN-2;32;6;;;;;"in section “Incorporating EU

This responsibility includes the selection and application of

whereas the German text is authoritative. Furthermore, management"

control as they consider necessary to enable the preparation of a 
combined separate non-financial report that is free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error. 
The EU Taxonomy Regulation and the Delegated Acts"
580;Commerzbank_2022_EN-2;32;9;;;;;"issued 
thereunder contain wording and terms that are still subject to considerable interpretation uncertainties and for which 
clarifications have not yet been published in every case. Therefore, 
management has disclosed thei r interpretation of the EU 
Taxonomy Regulation and the"
581;Commerzbank_2022_EN-2;32;10;;;;;"Delegated Acts adopted thereunder 
in section “Incorporating EU taxonomy” of the combined separate 
non-financial report. They are responsible for the defensibility of this interpretation. Due to the i mmanent risk that indeterminate 
legal terms may be interpreted diffe rently, the"
582;Commerzbank_2022_EN-2;32;11;;;;;"legal conformity of 
the interpretation is su bject to uncertainties. 
Independence and Quality Assurance of the
