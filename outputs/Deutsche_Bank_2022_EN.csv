5;Deutsche_Bank_2022_EN;4;0;;;;;;;;;;;3 Dear Readers, The Russian war of aggression in Ukraine, the energy crisis and the rapid rise in inflation have dominated the year 2022. All of these developments have once again made us aware of the wide range of risks we are exposed to – as an economy and society as a whole, but also each company individually. For us at Deutsche Bank, robust and comprehensive risk management is a cornerstone of our business. This has long since encompassed more than credit, market and other financial risks.
6;Deutsche_Bank_2022_EN;4;0;;;;;;;;;;;Non-financial risks have become an integral part of our risk management. If we do not systematically address the threats posed by climate change or increasing financial crime, we are putting the very basis of our business at risk. It is essential that we do everything in our power to further tighten our controls. This is also a key element in living up to our claim to be at the center of society.
7;Deutsche_Bank_2022_EN;4;0;;;;;;;;;;;It is equally essential that we engage with the communities in which we operate, and that we promote diversity , equity and inclusion inside and outside the bank. We want to be a bank that contributes to a greener (E), more socially responsible (S) and better managed (G) economy, and that is more committed than ever to the Ten Principles of the UN Global Compact. I am delighted that in 2022 we once again made great progress in all these areas.
8;Deutsche_Bank_2022_EN;4;0;;;;;;;;;;;To tackle climate change and enable our economy to transform, we have set ourselves concrete targets in the area of sustainability. At the beginning of 2020, we expected to reach € 200 billion in sustaina ble finance and investments in six years. By the end of 2022, we already achieved € 215 billion, excluding DWS. The fact that we reached our goal in only half the time clearly demonstrates how our businesses prioritize ESG considerations and have made it an integral part of their strategy.
9;Deutsche_Bank_2022_EN;4;0;;;;;;;;;;;"We have now set a new goal; to achieve a sustainable business volume of € 500 billion by 2025 for the years 2020 to 2025. This is an ambitious goal given that the criteria for measuring sustainability continue to evolve. Our regulators are driving this development, but we, too, strive for criteria that are as impact -oriented and transparent as possible, and we are continually improving here."
10;Deutsche_Bank_2022_EN;4;0;;;;;;;;;;;We have continued to develop in all areas of our sustainability strategy, with a focus on implementation. Having moved our Sustainability unit out of the Communications department in 2021, we created a new standalone Chief Sustainability Office in 2022 with new areas of strategy and implementation, appointing Jörg Eigendorf as Chief Su stainability Officer, reporting directly to me.
11;Deutsche_Bank_2022_EN;4;1;;;;;;;;;;;"At the same time, we further strengthened Group Sustainability, which, as part of the Chief Sustainability Of fice, primarily comprises policies and controls. This further sharpened focus means that we can de velop and implement our strategy even faster; we demonstrated our progress at our second Sustainability Deep Dive in March this year. Our roadmap to a climate- neutral banking business is key here."
12;Deutsche_Bank_2022_EN;4;1;;;;;;;;;;;"As a founding member of the Net -Zero Banking Alliance, in M arch 2022, for the first time, we fulfilled our voluntary commitment by publishing the carbon footprint of our corporate loan portfolio, which comprises around a quarter of our total loan book. In October 2022, we defined target paths for the four most ene rgy-intensive sectors – oil and gas (upstream); power generation; automotives (light vehicles); steel – with interim targets for 2030."
13;Deutsche_Bank_2022_EN;4;1;;;;;;;;;;;By gradually integrating CO 2 considerations into our decision -making processes, we can actively steer our progress here. Our goal is to make our credit portfolio climate- neutral by 2050. At the same time, we believe that we have a responsibility to support our clients on this transition and that this is the rig ht approach with regard to the global climate.
14;Deutsche_Bank_2022_EN;4;1;;;;;;;;;;;We would only consider ending a client relationship as a last resort if we fail t o agree on a common approach to fighting climate change. It does not help anyone if we as a bank reduce our own carbon footprint but fail to make the world any cleaner as a result. There is more progress to report. This includes the fact that, since mid- 2022, in order to continue doing business with us, our suppliers with an annual contract volume of more than € 500,000 are required to have an ESG rating.
15;Deutsche_Bank_2022_EN;4;1;;;;;;;;;;;By doing so, we are designing our entire value chain according to strict environmental and social criteria – with a focus on human rights. Accordingly, we have implemented all obligations under the German Supply Chain Due Diligence Act on time and will continue to do so consistently. As a bank with a global network, we are aware of our responsibility for fight ing financial crime on the front lines.
16;Deutsche_Bank_2022_EN;4;1;;;;;;;;;;;That is why we have stepped up our commitment to anti -financial crime by focusing more people on these issues, improving processes and establishing external partnerships. In 2022, for example, we increased our Anti -Financial Crime department by more than 340 to over 1,900 employees, and in mid- 2022 Management Board member Stefan Simon took over as a member of the Board of the Anti -Financial Crime Alliance (AFCA).
17;Deutsche_Bank_2022_EN;5;0;;;;;;;;;;;4 However, this alone is not enough. To entrench a strong risk culture, Deutsche Bank encourages everyone to speak out when something doesn't seem right. This “Speak -Up Culture” is what we expect. Another important aspect of a strong risk culture is that our bank can meet the requirement to record business- related communications. As such, our employees are only permitted to use approved communication channels, and Deutsche Bank has further strengthened its processes and controls here.
18;Deutsche_Bank_2022_EN;5;0;;;;;;;;;;;Although we understand we have work to do to deliver our controls remediation program and adapt it to increasing regulatory requirements, the progress so far across all elements has made our bank safer. We also see the value of our investments in exceptional times. Strong controls and good corporate governance have contributed to our ability to adapt to evolving sanctions and help clients deal with key market challenges. Our bank is represented in 58 countries and home to 157 nationalities.
19;Deutsche_Bank_2022_EN;5;0;;;;;;;;;;;Actively promoting diversity, equity and inclusion remains a priority and we continue to equip our people to fulfill this. We have made our goal of improving gender balance transparent, especially at our most senior management levels, and continue to make progress towards our 2025 targets. In the Human Rights Campaign's annual Corporate Equality Index, we received the highest score of 100 for 19 consecutive years.
20;Deutsche_Bank_2022_EN;5;0;;;;;;;;;;;"In order to further embed diversity, equity and inclusion in the bank’s culture, we rely on our managers; they must lead diverse teams, behave inclusively and support their employees in the ir careers. To support our leaders, we have created our Leadership Kompass, a set of eight behaviors that we expect from all of our leaders."
21;Deutsche_Bank_2022_EN;5;0;;;;;;;;;;;These include sustainable business practices, the development and well -being of our employees, and the way we put clients and employees at the heart of all decisions, in line with our values and beliefs. When it comes to social responsibility, our bank has a long and impressive history. This is deeply rooted in our culture, even and especially in difficult times. In response to the humanitarian plight of refugees from Ukraine, Deutsche Bank donated € 1 million in 2022.
22;Deutsche_Bank_2022_EN;5;0;;;;;;;;;;;Our employees donated a further € 500,000+ and many were involved in Ukraine aid projects. With the launch of the How We Live environmental projects in 2022, the bank is aligning its social responsibility strategy even more closely with its ESG objectives. These projects contribute towards the protection and regeneration of nature worldwide.
23;Deutsche_Bank_2022_EN;5;1;;;;;;;;;;;We are also proud to report that, by the end of 2022, more t han 1,000 of our employees in Germany had registered for the financial education project “So geht Geld”, which provides students with practical financial knowledge. This is far beyond our goal of recruiting 700 colleagues for the project by the end of the reporting year. In total, we invested more than € 55 million as part of our social commitment as well as in art, culture and sports projects.
24;Deutsche_Bank_2022_EN;5;1;;;;;;;;;;;More than 3 million people worldwide benefited from this. In addition, more than 18,700 employees volunteered on our social projects giving a total of almost 190,000 hours. This commitment is remarkable. It underpins that we are at the heart of soci ety and act responsibly. Progress on all of our non -financial targets is only possible if we are successful in business. We were able to meet this requirement in 2022 and achieved the best result in 15 years.
25;Deutsche_Bank_2022_EN;5;1;;;;;;;;;;;"We can look to the future with confidence; our bank is once again sustainably profitable. It is more efficient and has four strong, mutually- reinforcing, well -balanced business divisions. Our clients, our shareholders and our employees play a significant role in this success. Our special thanks therefore go to them. Yours sincerely, Christian Sewing."
26;Deutsche_Bank_2022_EN;6;0;;;;;;;;;;;5 Dear Readers, With its 2019 transformation, Deutsche Bank adopted a clear strategy and substantially improved its financial results. This transformation, which the Supervisory Board has continuously supported, has been successfully executed. As a result of the realignment, the bank has regained credibility and confidence , as I learned from numerous discussions with clients, employees, investors, supervisors and politicians since I took office.
27;Deutsche_Bank_2022_EN;6;0;;;;;;;;;;;To be successful in the long term it is not just the results that need to be right: the bank must meet its needs and those of all relevant stakeholders for important non -financial factors. This is why the Supervisory Board has been working intensively last year on the topics raised in this report.
28;Deutsche_Bank_2022_EN;6;0;;;;;;;;;;;Our focus has been on strengthening corporate governance through further reinforced controls and processes, supporting the transition to a more sustainable economy, and promoting the use of technology. In particular, effective controls and processes are essential for a global financial institution. By meeting regulatory requi rements and making a significant contribution to the fight against financial crime, we will strengthen our resilience.
29;Deutsche_Bank_2022_EN;6;0;;;;;;;;;;;At the same time, this is the basis for the social acceptance of our bank. Deutsche Bank has made significant remediation progress in recent years, but does not meet all of its own and its regulators’ expectations in certain areas yet. That is why, in July last year, we refocused the existing Integrity Committee. As a Regulatory Oversight Committee, it oversees the Management Board ’s actions with regard to complying with legislation, administrative regulations and internal policies .
30;Deutsche_Bank_2022_EN;6;0;;;;;;;;;;;The committee also supports the Supervisory Board in monitoring the litigation cases which are most relevant from a risk perspective. In addition, the Committee regularly review s the bank’s codes of ethics and conduct to encourage exemplary behavior by our employees in every respect, in addition to their legal obligations. It also remains a key objective for the bank to promote diversity and inclusion.
31;Deutsche_Bank_2022_EN;6;0;;;;;;;;;;;We also attach great importance to this principle in the composition of the Supervisory Board and the Management Board. Sustainable action and thinking are an integral part of Deutsche Bank’s strategy.
32;Deutsche_Bank_2022_EN;6;0;;;;;;;;;;;Consequently, the task of advising the Management Board on environmental (E), social responsibility (S) and corporate governance (G) matters has been transferred from the former Integrity Committee to the Strategy and Sustainability Committee, while the related financial and non -financial risks are supervised by the Risk Committee . Sustainability is a top priority for the Supervisory Board.
33;Deutsche_Bank_2022_EN;6;0;;;;;;;;;;;As a Global Hausbank, we support the transition to a sustainable and climate -neutral economy by enabling sustainable financing and investments and providing advice and support to clients in their transformation. In 2022, the Management Board also reported regularly on the bank’s progress in implementing the bank’s sustainability strategy. In addition to the path to a sustainable economy, technological innovations will shape banking in the years to come.
34;Deutsche_Bank_2022_EN;6;1;;;;;;;;;;;Our goal is to make the best use of artificial intelligence, machine learning and data to serve our clients. In addition to effective data management and cloud transformation, security in 2022 was the defining topic in the Committee on Technology, Data and Integration. The impact of the war in Ukraine on our cyber and information security was discussed regularly. A more detailed report on the work of the Supervisory Board on these and other issues can be found in Deutsche Bank’s Annual Report.
35;Deutsche_Bank_2022_EN;6;1;;;;;;;;;;;In recent years, Deutsche Bank has fundamentally transformed its business model. It is once again profitable and has re - connected closely to society and its stakeholders. We will continue along this path and the Supervisory Board will continue t o support the Management Board in implementing its strategy, strengthening controls and fulfilling Deutsche Bank’s social responsibilities. Yours, A lexander Wynaendts Chairman of the Supervisory Board Deutsche Bank AG.

Negative spillovers from the war in Ukraine as well as disruptions of supply chains, including energy supply shortages, could have the potential to fast -track Europe’s goals of carbon footprint reduction and energy independence by accelerating the transformation towards renewable energies (refer e.g. to REPowerEU initiative).
64;Deutsche_Bank_2022_EN;14;0;;;;;;;;;;;Being a global financial institution with a loan book of € 489 billion and assets under management of € 1.3 trillion, Deu tsche Bank believes that it is part of its responsibility to support and where possible, accelerate this historic transformation towards a more sustainable society and economy. This transformation affects the bank’s relationship with all its stakeholders. Clients need advice, products, and services to make progress on their transformation journeys.
65;Deutsche_Bank_2022_EN;14;0;;;;;;;;;;;Investors increasingly want to entrust their capital to companies with a credible sustainability strategy. Following clear guidance for sustainabilit y is also one cornerstone of attracting people who expect their employer to act decisively and to be purpose driven. Finally, society values businesses that act as responsible corporate citizens. While the transition towards a sustainable society and economy requires huge investments, sustainability goes beyond pure business.
66;Deutsche_Bank_2022_EN;14;0;;;;;;;;;;;Deutsche Bank has seen sustainability as an opportunity for many years. Consequently sustainability, which encompasses environmental, social and governance (ESG) aspects, is a central component of the “Global Hausbank” strategy. In 2022, the bank continued to embed sustainability into its products, policies and processes, focusing on the following four pillars: Sustainable Finance, Policies & Commitments, People & Own Operations as well as Thought Leadership & Stakeholder Engagement.
67;Deutsche_Bank_2022_EN;14;0;;;;;;;;;;;Making progress along these four pillars is aimed to enabl e the bank to maximize its contribution to the achievement of the Paris Climate Agreement’s targets and the United Nations (UN) Sustainable Development Goals. A lthough the bank strives to contribute indirectly to all 17 UN Sustainable Development Goals, as part of its sustainability strategy the focus is in particular on the sustainability targets shown below, which are particularly close to its business activity.
68;Deutsche_Bank_2022_EN;14;0;;;;;;;;;;;Sustainability strategy To underpin its long -standing commitment to sustainability, Deutsche Bank formally endorsed universal sustainability frameworks and initiatives. The bank is a member of the UN’s Environment Programme Finance Initiative (1992) and signatory to the ten principles of the UN Global Compact (2000), the Principles for Responsible Investment (through DWS, 2008), the Principles for Responsible Banking (2019) and the Net -Zero Banking Alliance (2021).

72;Deutsche_Bank_2022_EN;15;0;;;;;;;;;;;Key achievements along the four pillars are: Sustainable Finance Deutsche Bank has achieved a cumulative sustainable financing and investments volume of € 215 billion in 2022 (excluding DWS), thus outperforming its target of at least € 200 billion within three years. All business areas (excluding DWS) contributed to Deutsche Bank meeting this target. When this target was first announced in May 2020, it was planned to be achieved by the end of 2025.

In particular, the bank considers the EU Taxonomy’s technical screening criteria for the classification of activities as environmentally sustainable and specifically those related to the climate change mitigation and adaptation objectives.
130;Deutsche_Bank_2022_EN;20;0;;;;;;;;;;;As the overall understanding of environmental and social matters and the EU Taxonomy are evolving, these criteria may be modified.
131;Deutsche_Bank_2022_EN;20;0;;;;;;;;;;;Similarly to “Do No Significant Harm” and “Minimum social safeguards” checks of client performance against environmental and social objectives required by the EU Taxonomy, Deutsche Bank already conducts reviews of clients’ overall management approach and performance towards environmental and social challenges common to the industries in which the client operates ahead of their implementation for the purpose of Taxonomy alignment reporting next year (for more information on these reviews, see.

Decrease of the financing volumes compared to the prior year reflects lower levels of sustainability activities as companies prioriti zed their responses to the macro -economic and geo -political uncertainty and reduced lending and refinancing in a rising interest rate environment.
149;Deutsche_Bank_2022_EN;22;0;;;;;;;;;;;Lower issuance volumes compared to the prior year reflect reduced primary issuance activity and volatile conditions in the global capital markets in 2022.

317;Deutsche_Bank_2022_EN;39;0;;;;;;;;;;;Governan ce GRI 2 -13/25, 3 -3, 404 -2, FS1, FS4 Deutsche Bank’s governance of climate risk varies by activity. The governance of the activities that drive the bank’s transformation, including those needed to fulfill Deutsche Bank’s pledge to net zero by 2050 (as a fo unding member of the Net-Zero Banking Alliance), is led by dedicated steering committees as well as leveraging existing governance structures.
318;Deutsche_Bank_2022_EN;39;0;;;;;;;;;;;By contrast, the governance of business -as-usual activities is incorporated in the bank’s existing management str ucture. Deutsche Bank’s Group Sustainability Committee , chaired by the CEO, acts as the senior decision- making body for sustainability -related matters at group level including those related to climate risks and the bank’s net zero targets .
319;Deutsche_Bank_2022_EN;39;0;;;;;;;;;;;The Committee r eceives regular updates on risk -related topics, including developments in Deutsche Bank’s financed emissions and net zero alignment targets as well as progress reports from risk- related workstreams. The Management Board also receives regular updates on financed emissions and net zero alignment via the Risk and Capital Profile report.
320;Deutsche_Bank_2022_EN;39;0;;;;;;;;;;;Each of Deutsche Bank’s core businesses integrates climate and broader ESG risks into planning and risk appetite statements as part of the bank’s annual strategic planning proc ess, approved by the Management Board. In 2022 the bank also established a Net -Zero Forum , responsible for the assessment of new transactions with a significant impact on the bank’s financed emissions and / or net zero targets.
321;Deutsche_Bank_2022_EN;39;0;;;;;;;;;;;Members of the forum are senior representatives from Business, Risk and the Chief Sustainability Office. The Group Risk Committee, chaired by the Chief Risk Officer, is established by the Management Board to serve as the central forum for review and decision making on matters related to risk, capital, and liquidity. This includes the responsibility for developing the bank’s Climate Risk Framework.
322;Deutsche_Bank_2022_EN;39;0;;;;;;;;;;;The Committee also approved the Bank’s decarbonization targets and its internal risk appetite thresholds. A number of delegated sub -commit tees of the Group Risk Committee are responsible for the development and management of specific elements of climate risk: – The Enterprise Risk Committee, which is composed of senior risk experts from various risk disciplines, focuses on enterprise -wide risk trends, events, and cross -risk portfolios.

326;Deutsche_Bank_2022_EN;40;0;;;;;;;;;;;An ESG Risk Forum, comprised of experts across all key risk types and other control functions, oversees the integration of climate risk into the bank’s existing risk frameworks for managing financial and non -financial risks. ESG topics are also regularly discussed in business unit risk councils and other committees and fora.
327;Deutsche_Bank_2022_EN;40;0;;;;;;;;;;;Information around the committees in the organization chart that are not covered in this section can be found in the governance section of the chapter “Sustainability Strategy”. Deutsche Bank has incorporated environmental, social and governance risks into the group’s risk taxonomy and adopted a Climate and Environmental Risk Policy at group level outlining roles, responsibilities as well as qualitative risk appetite principles and quantitative risk -appetite metrics.
328;Deutsche_Bank_2022_EN;40;0;;;;;;;;;;;Training and risk awareness sessions on climate risk were held throughout the year. The sessions were available to Risk Management staff and senior leadership teams around the globe, on topics such as the bank’s net zero targets, sustainable Finance , ESG fundamentals and regulatory landscapes, ESG and the role of compliance, and others.
329;Deutsche_Bank_2022_EN;40;0;;;;;;;;;;;Compliance is a part of the overall Governance around Sustainability and ESG risks described above and is represented in the Risk, Governance & Controls workstream (under the Sustainability Strategy Steering Committee) and in the ESG Risk Forum. Compliance has also set up a global ESG working group with representation from all relevant areas of the function and other 2nd Line of Defense functions such as NFRM and Legal .
330;Deutsche_Bank_2022_EN;40;0;;;;;;;;;;;The working group provides a platform to exchange knowledge and discuss topical aspects of ESG. It carries out activities such as changes to policies, design and delivery of ESG -specific trainings, changes to the compliance annual risk assessment, report ing to the Compliance Executive Committee and to the management board as part of the annual compliance report to the management board.
331;Deutsche_Bank_2022_EN;40;0;;;;;;;;;;;The working group also assesses further need for change in the mandate and set -up of the Compliance function to meet stat utory requirements and regulatory expectations on an ongoing basis and advises the Compliance Executive Committee on those. In 2022 the Compliance ESG working group conducted a review of the entire Compliance- owned policy portfolio, with amendments being implemented ad -hoc or as part of the annual policy review.
332;Deutsche_Bank_2022_EN;40;0;;;;;;;;;;;The Compliance Risk Type Policy was supplemented with several additional risk scenarios addressing ESG risks. A two -module training on ESG and the related tasks for compliance officers was delivere d to a global audience. ESG risks formed an integral part of the Compliance annual risk assessment in 2022 and compliance officers participated in the risk and control assessments with a focus on ESG.
333;Deutsche_Bank_2022_EN;40;0;;;;;;;;;;;Regarding the 3rd Line of Defense, Deutsche Bank’s Internal Audit function (Group Audit) provides independent and objective assurance to the Management Board of Deutsche Bank AG and its group companies on the adequacy of the design, operating effectiveness and efficiency of the bank’s risk management system which includes climate and environmental risks. Group Audit also acts as an independent, proactive and forward- looking challenger and adviser to Senior Management of the Group.

335;Deutsche_Bank_2022_EN;41;0;;;;;;;;;;;In 2022, Group Audit conducted, a number of audits covering ESG -related risks, including an audit on ESG Governance, an audit on Risk and Control Assessment including Greenwashing, a targeted review on the Climate Risk Stress Testing of the European Central Bank and an audit on climate and environmental risks in Credit Risk Management of corporate and investment bank divis ions.
336;Deutsche_Bank_2022_EN;41;0;;;;;;;;;;;Furthermore, Group Audit developed guidance on auditing ESG, established a dedicated ESG team and a global working group, as well as defined a comprehensive audit coverage plan. Risk management strategy Deutsche Bank’s management of climate risks and opportunities is part of its broader sustainability strategy and supports the commitment to align the bank’s portfolio with net zero by 2050.
337;Deutsche_Bank_2022_EN;41;0;;;;;;;;;;;Other components of the bank’s sustainability strategy, including growth in sustainable financing and investment volumes and broader Environmental and Social Policy Framework, are described in the “Sustainable finance” and “Environmental and social due diligence” chapters of this report. Climate risks and opportunities GRI 3 -3, FS5 Climate change and environmental d egradation may lead to the emergence of new sources of financial and non- financial risks.
338;Deutsche_Bank_2022_EN;41;0;;;;;;;;;;;Transition risks to the bank’s portfolios are increasingly likely to materialize in the short -to-medium term as governments introduce ambitious climate- related target s and policies, as society adapts its behavior and as investor appetite for carbon intensive clients / sectors becomes more selective.
339;Deutsche_Bank_2022_EN;41;0;;;;;;;;;;;These risks have been exacerbated by the current geopolitical environment and the war in Ukraine, which put additional st rain on the global energy market and has increased the need to develop independent energy -efficiency measures across industries.
340;Deutsche_Bank_2022_EN;41;0;;;;;;;;;;;Acute and chronic physical climate risk factors arising from higher global temperatures are expected to increase in severity even if decarbonization efforts prove successful, impacting Deutsche Bank’s operational risks and the risk to the assets of the bank’s clients.
341;Deutsche_Bank_2022_EN;41;0;;;;;;;;;;;As explained in more detail in the sub -chapter Risk management framework – Risk identification and materiality assessment below, Deutsche Bank has conducted a structured materiality assessment to estimate potential impacts of these risk drivers across risk types and established policies, procedures and dedicated risk appetite to manage risks, including: – Interim (2030) and final (2050) net -zero aligned targets for key carbon intensive sectors to manage transition risks, which are fully.

343;Deutsche_Bank_2022_EN;42;0;;;;;;;;;;;41 Deutsche Bank Transition toward a sustainable and climate -neutral economy Non-Financial Report 2022 Climate risk For the financial sector, the transition to a net -zero economy and adaptation to climate change are not only a source of risks, but also present significant opportunities. The International Energy Agency estimates th at, to reach net zero emissions by 2050, annual clean energy investment worldwide will need to more than triple by 2030 to around U.S.$ 4 trillion.
344;Deutsche_Bank_2022_EN;42;0;;;;;;;;;;;In this context, banks have a significant role to play in financing sustainable activities (e.g., renewable energy projects) and investments required by clients in highly carbon intensive sectors to transition their business towards less carbon intensive operating models. Deutsche Bank’s Sustainable Financing target, including lending and other activities with ESG -linked KPIs, is in place to ensure that the bank’s activities are aligned with this transition.
345;Deutsche_Bank_2022_EN;42;0;;;;;;;;;;;"Risk management framework GRI 201- 2, 3-3, FS1, FS3 Deutsche Bank’s Climate Risk Management Framework has four key elements: risk identification and material ity assessment; integration into risk type frameworks and processes; scenario analysis and stress testing; and integration into risk appetite via utilization of a range of risk metrics and targets."
346;Deutsche_Bank_2022_EN;42;0;;;;;;;;;;;The bank’s development of tools, methodologies, and metrics for integrating climate risks into risk appetite frameworks, policies, and processes, has significantly progressed in 2022.
347;Deutsche_Bank_2022_EN;42;0;;;;;;;;;;;This includes the bank’s ability to identify, assess, and moni tor climate risks included in its balance sheet and operations, to s et quantitative risk -appetite thresholds to minimize downside risks, and to review the development of its financed emissions and carbon intensity, both of which must fall over the medium to long term to support the transition to a low -carbon economy. The framework is described in Deutsche Bank’s Climate and Environmental Risk Management Policy.
348;Deutsche_Bank_2022_EN;43;0;;;;;;;;;;;42 Deutsche Bank Transition toward a sustainable and climate -neutral economy Non-Financial Report 2022 Climate risk Risk identification and materiality assessment Deutsche Bank has conducted a comprehensive materiality assessment of climate and other environmental risks to identify key impacts across potentially affected risk types in the short, medium and long term .
349;Deutsche_Bank_2022_EN;43;0;;;;;;;;;;;The drivers considered in the analysis were climate transition risks arising from policy, technology and behavioral changes, acute and chronic physical risks and other environmental risks. The assessment of acute physical and policy- driven transitio n risk impacts on credit risk utilizes models developed for the 2022 ECB climate stress test. Environmental risk impacts on credit risk are assessed based on selected internal scenario analysis.
350;Deutsche_Bank_2022_EN;43;0;;;;;;;;;;;Internal expert judgement is utilized for other transition an d chronic physical risks pending the development of quantitative estimation approaches.
351;Deutsche_Bank_2022_EN;43;0;;;;;;;;;;;Strategic risk impacts from transition risk drivers are estimated based on the share of client revenues in sectors in scope o f net zero targets generated from clients w ith no stated decarbonization plans where it is assumed that business activity is incrementally scaled back as well as internal estimates of lost market share if Deutsche Bank fails to adapt to changing clie nt demand for sustainable products.
352;Deutsche_Bank_2022_EN;43;0;;;;;;;;;;;Strategic risk impacts from chronic physical risk drivers are estimated based on costs to relocate critical infrastructure to other regions, referencing the cost to establish Deutsche Bank’s tech cente r in Berlin. For other risk drivers Deutsche Bank utilizes historic experience and internal expert judgement. Physical risk impacts on market risk are assessed based on observed financial market impacts of selected severe events (Hurricane Katrina, Fukushima Tsu nami).
353;Deutsche_Bank_2022_EN;43;0;;;;;;;;;;;For transition risk policy changes, instantaneous marke t price shocks were modelled for high transition risk industries to estimate impacts. Assessment of other risks was based on internal expert judgement. Liquidity risk impacts are assessed based on a combination of internal stress testing under Net -Zero by 2050 and Delayed Transition scenarios as well as an extreme flood scenario and a reputational -risk driven scenario, supplemented by internal expert judgement.
354;Deutsche_Bank_2022_EN;43;0;;;;;;;;;;;Operational risk impacts from acute physical risks are assessed based on a combination of internal city/regional wide outage impact estimates and existing group risk analysis of Deutsche Bank’s ability to respond and recover from a severe disruption to applications, data and third parties. Review of governance drivers linked to inadequate management o f risks was primarily based on historic event data.
355;Deutsche_Bank_2022_EN;43;0;;;;;;;;;;;ESG -related liability consequences were assessed based on structured analysis of five scenarios. Assessment of other risk drivers was based on internal expert judgement. Reputational risk impacts from transition risk and other environmental risk were assessed based on an assumed reduction in client activity with Deutsche Bank negatively impacting fee and commission income. No significant impacts were identified from other risk drivers.
356;Deutsche_Bank_2022_EN;43;0;;;;;;;;;;;The key short -term a nd medium -term risks (<5yr time horizon) identified were acute physical risks, transition risks arising from policy changes and other environmental risks. Material longer -term risks in relation to chronic physical events and additional impacts from transit ion risks are assessed as most impactful for credit and strategic risks.
357;Deutsche_Bank_2022_EN;43;1;;;;;;;;;;;The risk drivers covered in the materiality assessment are used to integrate climate risk considerations into the risk identification process which functions as a basis for the group risk inventory and reviewed against internal controls .
358;Deutsche_Bank_2022_EN;44;0;;;;;;;;;;;43 Deutsche Bank Transition toward a sustainable and climate -neutral econ omy Non-Financial Report 2022 Climate risk Integration into risk type frameworks and processes Credit risk Climate risk drivers are integrated across the different stages of the transaction lifecycle (including transaction approval / client onboarding, risk classification and credit ratings, portfolio analysis and monitoring, collateral valuation).
359;Deutsche_Bank_2022_EN;44;0;;;;;;;;;;;Deutsche Bank's Environmental and Social Policy Framework outlines specific restrictions, due diligence and escalation requirements for sectors wit h inherently elevated potential for negative environmental impacts. In addition, new transactions or limit extensions with a significant impact on the bank’s financed emissions and / or net zero targets are reviewed by a dedicated Net -Zero Forum consisting of senior representatives from the Business, Risk and the Chief Sustainability Office.
360;Deutsche_Bank_2022_EN;44;0;;;;;;;;;;;This review includes an assessment of client sustainability disclosures, transition strategies, decarbonization targets and governance. New transactions must fit within Deutsche Bank’s internal sectoral risk appetite aligned to net zero targets. The bank uses an internal climate risk taxonomy to identify sectors which are most impacted by climate transition risks.
361;Deutsche_Bank_2022_EN;44;0;;;;;;;;;;;Sect ors classified as high risk are subject to enhanced due diligence requirements in the credit rating process and transaction approvals. As part of the bank’s industry risk management framework, the Enterprise Risk Management team assesses sectoral risks and assigns each sector short - and long -term risk ratings. The long -term risk ratings include an assessment of a sector’s inherent vulnera bility to climate risks and are an important input for setting sectoral risk appetite.
362;Deutsche_Bank_2022_EN;44;0;;;;;;;;;;;Long- term risk ratings are incorporated into the bank’s internal counterparty rating model which the bank uses to guide client risk appetite. As part of the internal cr edit rating process climate and other ESG risks must be assessed and, where deemed material, documented. This may lead to adjustments of the relevant rating parameter (i.e. , “special risks”).
363;Deutsche_Bank_2022_EN;44;0;;;;;;;;;;;With regards to the valuation of collateral, the bank’s Global Collateral Policy sets its ESG standards based on respective minimum requirements of the Capital Requirement Regulation for initial valuation, monitoring and review over the life of the loan. Deutsche Bank’s underwriting standards require real estate coll ateral to be insured by the client. Such insurance often provides a protection against natural hazards.
364;Deutsche_Bank_2022_EN;44;0;;;;;;;;;;;In some countries supplemental insurance against natural hazard is provided by the government. The bank’s German retail mortgage loan portfolio accounts for more than 80% of real estate collateral. The bank has estimated the amount of residential loans exposed to acute physical events, such as drought, earthquake, lightning, heavy rain, flooding, and according to where the collateral is located.
365;Deutsche_Bank_2022_EN;44;1;;;;;;;;;;;The analysis was carried out through the Nomenclature of Territorial Units (NUTS) level 3 for purposes of aggregation. NUTS level 3 in Germany are Kreise (districts) and kreisfreie Städte (urban districts), of which there are 401 in total. At year end 2022, the bank had book value exposure of € 20.5 billion in 100 -year flood zones. Compared to 2021 the volume increased by € 1.0 billion in line with the overall portfolio growth of the German mortgages.
366;Deutsche_Bank_2022_EN;44;1;;;;;;;;;;;In Germany, the bank owns additional insurance agai nst natural hazards, which provides further safeguard against physical risks. Acute physical risks to clients’ assets and collateral are also considered in the assessment of Commercial Real Estate credit risk exposures.
367;Deutsche_Bank_2022_EN;44;1;;;;;;;;;;;Physical risks to real estate coll ateral are addressed primarily through the requirements outlined in the bank’s Credit Policies and Process Guides, which prescribe financed properties to be adequately and appropriately insured. The assessment of insurance requirements considers the potent ial impact of natural disasters, such as storms, floods, and earthquakes.
368;Deutsche_Bank_2022_EN;44;1;;;;;;;;;;;Similar requirements are also in place for other physical collateral, including large movable assets (such as airplanes and ships) and smaller assets (such as cars and machines). The assessment is documented by means of the Capital Requirements Regulation’s compliance checklists. Insurance coverage on loan collateral is monitored on a regular basis, including by means of onsite inspections.
369;Deutsche_Bank_2022_EN;44;1;;;;;;;;;;;Additional disclosures around exposures to physical risks are included in the bank’s Pillar 3 Reporting 2022. Market risk As part of the Market Risk Identification process individual business lines are asked to consider forward -looking and/or idiosyncratic material risks including climate and other ESG risks, which must be included in the Market Risk identification documentation.
370;Deutsche_Bank_2022_EN;44;1;;;;;;;;;;;Climate -related risks are currently managed within the existing market risk framework and treated as a price trigger, in the same way as market events such as central bank announcements or earnings announcements. Market risk monitors and reports “brown” exposure (as per Deutsche Bank’s climate risk taxonomy) and financed emissions in its traded credit portfolio. The report provides granular views required for business management of exposures.
371;Deutsche_Bank_2022_EN;45;0;;;;;;;;;;;44 Deutsche Bank Transition toward a sustainable and climate -neutral economy Non-Financial Report 2022 Climate risk Liquidity risk Deutsche Bank uses stress testing and pathway analysis to assess the impact of climate risk on liquidity. In particular, the bank’s stressed Net Liquidity Position scenarios, that are run on a daily basis, include climat e disasters as possible triggers of stress (physical risks).
372;Deutsche_Bank_2022_EN;45;0;;;;;;;;;;;In 2022 the bank also developed and ran an internal climate stress test on liquidity , discussed in section “Scenario analysis and stress testing” of this chapter. Physical climate risk is cover ed by the bank’s stressed Net Liquidity Position liquidity risk appetite, as one of the possible triggers that is modelled for liquidity risk events. Work done on physical risk shows that these risks are in most reasonable cases smaller than other risks th at the bank daily reserves liquidity for.
373;Deutsche_Bank_2022_EN;45;0;;;;;;;;;;;Transition risk, which is expected to develop incrementally over many years, will be managed through the Group’s annual funding planning processes. Non-financial risk / Operational risk Non-Financial Risk Managemen t integrates climate- related and broader ESG drivers into certain aspects of its Operational Risk Management Framework.
374;Deutsche_Bank_2022_EN;45;0;;;;;;;;;;;In 2022, an ESG flag was introduced to the taxonomy of sub -risk types under the overarching risk type “operational risk” to identify those sub- risk types where ESG is considered a key risk driver. This flagging will form part of regular reviews of the taxonomy. The integration efforts further progressed in 2022 through a new ESG driven risk review, which was used as an input into the regul ar risk & control assessment exercise carried out globally across divisions.
375;Deutsche_Bank_2022_EN;45;0;;;;;;;;;;;This review will also help inform further integration activities in the Operational Risk Management Framework. In line with the Operational Risk Management Framework, risk identif ication takes place through analysis of past internal and external operational risk events. Exploratory scenario analysis is also used to analyze potential event situations and the effectiveness of related controls to identify areas for further risk mitigation and strengthening of the control environment.
376;Deutsche_Bank_2022_EN;45;0;;;;;;;;;;;This library of scenarios included, for example, scenarios on physical risk (e.g., extreme weather events impacting the bank's dat a centers) as well as on Sustainable Finance products.
377;Deutsche_Bank_2022_EN;45;0;;;;;;;;;;;In the materiality assessment of climate and environmental risks conducted in 2022 (described earlier in this chapter) , the core transmission channels for Operational risk were identified as (i) direct damage or unavailability of service to clients as a result of physical ri sk impacts from extreme weather events and (ii) ESG -related liability consequences, which can amongst others, result from greenwashing.
378;Deutsche_Bank_2022_EN;45;0;;;;;;;;;;;In order to mitigate physical risk impacts on its operations , Deutsche Bank has a long -standing Business Continuity Management framework in place which employs an all -hazards approach.
379;Deutsche_Bank_2022_EN;45;0;;;;;;;;;;;This framework requires the 1 st Line of Defense to conduct a Business Impact Analysis for the disruption of their processes/services and develop and regularly test recovery strategies for mandatory Business Continuity Management planning scenarios (such as loss of facility, pandemic / unavailability of staff, loss of business application, loss of 3rd Party, tested regardless of the root cause of the disrupti on).
380;Deutsche_Bank_2022_EN;45;0;;;;;;;;;;;Business Continuity related scenario libraries and other framework documentation including Risk Appetite Statements are regularly reviewed and cover explicitly climate- related scenarios for some areas.
381;Deutsche_Bank_2022_EN;45;1;;;;;;;;;;;These include: – The Business Continuity Management and Crisis Management Policy incl udes planning scenario examples for a) loss of primary production facility, b) significant staff unavailability and c) loss of third party – The bank’s city- wide outage planning demands yearly exercises in service center locations such as India, Philippines & Jacksonville, where climate- related scenarios are prevalent – In the severe scenario narrative library, a climate change & natural hazard driver is.
382;Deutsche_Bank_2022_EN;45;1;;;;;;;;;;;included among the emergency risk drivers – As part of the existing B usiness Continuity Management program, the bank has established hazard /region specific plans such as the Hurricane Plans for the Americas Region Regulators have increased their scrutiny on the topic of “greenwashing” (i.
383;Deutsche_Bank_2022_EN;45;1;;;;;;;;;;;e., where companies are considered to obtain an unfair competitive advantage by inaccurately portraying, exaggerating or misleading the selling of and/or contents of products, or their general image, as being ‘environmentally friendly’ , green or sustainable). Stringent controls are considered to be a key eleme nt to prevent and mitigate the risk of greenwashing.
384;Deutsche_Bank_2022_EN;45;1;;;;;;;;;;;Analysis is therefore underway to review the greenwashing -related regulatory landscape, external events, impacted risk types and internal controls. In addition, work was kicked- off in 2022 that focuses o n triggers of potential ESG -related litigations. The outcome of these analyses as well as the business- run ESG driven risk review will be used, where applicable, to enhance the control environment in 2023.
385;Deutsche_Bank_2022_EN;45;1;;;;;;;;;;;Addressing this risk in an adequate manner support s: – Investors’ and society’s trust in the financial industry to support the transformation of the economy towards de -carbonization and sustainability, as envisaged by the European’s Commission Action Plan on Sustainable Finance – Protection of Deutsche Bank’s reputation – Mitigation of the risk of regulatory enforcement or civil litigation.
386;Deutsche_Bank_2022_EN;46;0;;;;;;;;;;;45 Deutsche Bank Transition toward a sustaina ble and climate -neutral economy Non-Financial Report 2022 Climate risk The management of reputational risk arising from clim ate-related risks is covered extensively in the following chapter of this report, “Environmental and social due diligence ”. Scenario analysis and stress testing The bank participated in the 2022 climate risk stress test of the European Central Bank.
387;Deutsche_Bank_2022_EN;46;0;;;;;;;;;;;In preparation for the exercise, the bank’s stress test methodology workstream developed methodologies for assessing portfolio impacts under the ECB’s set of scenarios. These scenarios included transition risk scenarios for credit (long and short term) and market risk (short term only), and physical risk scenarios, for credit risk only.
388;Deutsche_Bank_2022_EN;46;0;;;;;;;;;;;The three long term scenarios, based on the scenarios of the Network for Greening the Financial System with a time horizon spanning to 2050, were: – An orderly scenario, which assumes an orderly transition with a smooth reduction in CO 2 emissions to achieve the carbon emission goals by 2050 – A disorde rly scenario, which assumes a disorderly transition in which CO 2 emissions decrease slowly until 2030, and causing a disorderly transition in the following years to achieve the emission.

Reductions came despite total loan commitments increasing from € 246.9 billion to € 258.2 billion and reflect an 8% reduction in the overall portfolio emissions intensity on a committed basis.
410;Deutsche_Bank_2022_EN;47;11;;;;;;;;;;;The large st reductions were observed in carbon intensive sectors such as Oil and Gas, Utilities an d Steel, Metals and Mining due to falling loan commitments and / or rebalancing towards clients with lower emission intensities.

412;Deutsche_Bank_2022_EN;48;0;;;;;;;;;;;"3 MtCO2e/y; (ii) client’s moving from proxy to client specific emission factors which led to a finan ced emissions reduction of 1.4 MtCO2e/y; and (iii) FX translation effects of the euro equivalent loan exposures which led to a financed emissions increase of 1.7 MtCO2e/y, due to U.S. dollar strengthening versus the euro from year end 2021 to year end 2022."
413;Deutsche_Bank_2022_EN;48;0;;;;;;;;;;;In Q3 2022, the bank’s financed emissions methodology moved to a new ESG data provider in order to derive client specific emission factors and the bank has decided to restate its baseline year for financed emissions for fairer year -on-year comparison. The resultant impact was minimal being at the total corporate lending level a financed emissions reduction of 0.9 MtCO2e/y on a total loan commitment basis and a financed emissions increase of 0.5 MtCO2e/y on a loan outstanding basis.
414;Deutsche_Bank_2022_EN;48;0;;;;;;;;;;;To allow for the monitor ing of climate risk metrics in the bank’s portfolio, the Group Risk Committee, the Enterprise Risk Committee, and the Group Sustainability Committee receive a quarterly climate risk report that includes financed emissions, exposure to carbon -intensive sect ors, alignment with portfolio decarbonization targets and other climate risk -related topics, including key industry and regulatory developments.
415;Deutsche_Bank_2022_EN;48;0;;;;;;;;;;;Methodological note on the financed emissions tables: financed emissions are calculated both on a loan outstanding and on a total commitment basis, while the values disclosed in the Non- Financial Report 2021 were calculated on a loan outstanding basis only. Estimates of financed emissions on a total commitment basis have been added to align with the approach used for the bank’s decarboni zation targets .
416;Deutsche_Bank_2022_EN;48;0;;;;;;;;;;;Financed emissions shown in this report rely on MSCI data and the emissions factors of the Partnership for Carbon Accounting Financials (“PCAF”) . Differences in the datasets of MSCI and Refinitiv, which was used for last year’s report, resulted in differences in the 2021 financed emissions figures shown on a loan outstanding basis in the two reports (and in differences in PCAF’s Data Quality Scores).
417;Deutsche_Bank_2022_EN;48;0;;;;;;;;;;;PCAF Data Q uality Scores are calculated according to the rules outlined in the Global GHG Accounting and Reporting Standard for the Financial Industry, published by the Partnership. Current scores reflect the extent to which sectoral proxy estimates were utilized in the calc ulation of Financed Emissions and are an indication of the challenges that the bank and the industry still face with getting access to consistent and audited client specific climate risk data.
418;Deutsche_Bank_2022_EN;48;0;;;;;;;;;;;More information on Deutsche Bank’s application of the PCAF sta ndard can be found in the bank’s White Paper Towards Net Zero Emissions (*). Net zero targets In October 2022 Deutsche Bank published quantitative 2030 (interim) and 2050 (f inal) decarbonization targets for four carbon intensive sectors.
419;Deutsche_Bank_2022_EN;48;0;;;;;;;;;;;Deutsche Bank uses the Net Zero Emissions by 2050 scenario of the International Energy Agency as a basis for target setting, with methodologies largely based on that of the Paris Agreement Capital Transition Assessment. The Net Zero Emissions by 2050 scenario has the benefit of being consistent with limiting global warming to no more than 1.5 degree Celsius above pre- industrial levels by 2100 and of complying with the guidelines of the Net- Zero Banking Alliance.
420;Deutsche_Bank_2022_EN;48;1;;;;;;;;;;;Since Deutsche Bank’s publication of decarbonization approaches in March 2021, the work around pathway alignment in the industry evolved significantly. For this reason, the bank decided to make selective amendments to the original methodologies expressed in the March 2022 White Paper Towards Net Zero Emissions (*) , the most significant of which is the use of absolute Scope 3 financed emissions for the oil & gas target (which was originally intensity -based).
421;Deutsche_Bank_2022_EN;48;1;;;;;;;;;;;Targets for the other three in -scope sectors are based on physical intensity metrics. The bank’s decarbonization targets are fully integrated into Deutsche Bank’s risk appetite and broader risk management framework. The bank also uses additional, sector -specific, key performance indicators to monitor and steer climate risk across its portfolios.
422;Deutsche_Bank_2022_EN;48;1;;;;;;;;;;;Examples of these indicators are Scope 1 and 2 absolute emissions (for outstanding loans and commitments), technology mix es and the share of clients with reported net zero targets .

The reduction came despite loan commitments increasing year-on-year from € 9.7 billion to € 10.4 billion as client liquidity needs increased due to the European energy crisis and reflects a general improvement in the average physical emissions intensity of the portfolio.
428;Deutsche_Bank_2022_EN;49;1;;;;;;;;;;;The bank’s data provider Asset Impact (formerly known as Asset Resolution) introduced significant improvements to their Power Generation m ethodology resulting in more accurate representation of asset level information of Deutsche Bank’s clients.

Steel: The Scope 1 and 2 physical emission intensity of Deutsche Bank’s Steel portfolio was 1,495 kgCO 2e/ t as of year end 2022, falling 1.6% year -on-year. The decline in emissions intensity was less pronounced than the 7.
430;Deutsche_Bank_2022_EN;49;2;;;;;;;;;;;4% drop in loan commitments due to the portfolio weighted approach followed by the PACTA methodology.

DWS integrates climate- related risks, alongside other sustainability -related risks, into the existing corporate and investment risk measurement and management frameworks.
441;Deutsche_Bank_2022_EN;51;0;;;;;;;;;;;The DWS approach on integration of climate- related risks in the risk management strategy and processes has been formalized within a dedicated Sustainability Risk Management Policy. Within the revised version of this policy, ESG risk themes impacting DWS group as well as the interaction of such ESG risk themes on corporate and investment risks has been documented.
442;Deutsche_Bank_2022_EN;51;0;;;;;;;;;;;Furthermore, ESG risk theme strategies have been allocated to the identified ESG risk themes to provide strategic guidance on the implementation of climate risk management processes. In addition to and in alignment with the above, DWS risk management has continued the integration of climate -related risks in corporate and investment risk processes.
443;Deutsche_Bank_2022_EN;51;0;;;;;;;;;;;The integration activities resulted amongst others in the implementation of dedicated processes for climate -related investment risk across the product ranges in Europe, Middle East and Africa as well as the integration of climate- related risks – and other sustainabi lity risks – in risk assessment processes. Furthermore, the integration of climate -related risks in the risk appetite statement has been evolving.

455;Deutsche_Bank_2022_EN;53;0;;;;;;;;;;;The bank has committed to understand the environmental and social challenges and risks associated with a transaction or client and has developed robust frameworks and systematic risk evaluation processes. Regarding environmental and social risks, the bank’s management process is summarized in the “Climate risk” chapter and in the “Environmental and social policy framework” section of this chapt er. This latter Framework in turn is an integral part of the bank’s Reputational Risk Framework.

While human rights due diligence is a cross- sectoral issue, some sectors and activities have an inherently higher risk of negatively impacting human rights.
534;Deutsche_Bank_2022_EN;59;0;;;;;;;;;;;"Thus, the Environmental and Social Policy Framework includes specific human rights- related expectations and requirements that apply to the sectors in scope of the Framework. Special attention will be paid to cases involving resettlement; cases where the bank identifies potential negative impacts on indigenous peoples; and cases where clients use securit y forces for site protection."
535;Deutsche_Bank_2022_EN;59;1;;;;;;;;;;;If Deutsche Bank has concerns about a client with regards to human rights, it consults with relevant stakeholders. This might include direct engagement with the client as well as with civil society representatives that are familiar with the situation. Where appropriate, the bank obtains the advice of independent experts.
536;Deutsche_Bank_2022_EN;59;1;;;;;;;;;;;Based on all available information and its assessment of the risks that have been identified, the bank decides on the further course of action, which may include termination of a business relationship. The implementation of the Equator Principles (*), which the bank officially adopted in 2020, further underscores its human rights risk assessments for eligible proj ects and its commitment to human rights preservation for transactions outside the scope of the Equator Principles.
537;Deutsche_Bank_2022_EN;59;1;;;;;;;;;;;In 2022, the bank continued to conduct comprehensive trainings to ensure that relevant business areas have an in -depth understanding of the E quator Principles as well as the requirements for assessing the impacts on potential rights holders in the various projects that it finances.

540;Deutsche_Bank_2022_EN;59;1;;;;;;;;;;;Global Anti -Financial Crime policies define minimum standards for managing financial crime risks, including those with implications for hu man rights. These bank -wide polices are supplemented by country- specific policies and procedures that reflect national laws and regulations.
541;Deutsche_Bank_2022_EN;60;0;;;;;;;;;;;59 Deutsche Bank Transition toward a sustainable and climate -neutral economy Non-Financial Report 2022 Human rights The Anti -Financial Crime human rights working group, which is part of the above- described bank -wide Human Rights F orum, was established in 2021 to develop and pursue concrete measures and initiatives within the Anti -Financial Crime function to fight modern slavery and human traffi cking.
542;Deutsche_Bank_2022_EN;60;0;;;;;;;;;;;As a practical example of the progress made in 2022, modern slavery and human trafficking related key risk drivers were incorporated within Deutsche Bank’s Non -Financial Risk Taxonomy. This is going to further support the enhancement of Deutsche Bank’s control framework. Independent of the working group the Anti -Financial Crime department pro- actively contributed to initiatives within several Public Private Partnerships.
543;Deutsche_Bank_2022_EN;60;0;;;;;;;;;;;Deutsche Bank is currently leading the workstream “Financial Flows of Human Trafficking” within the German Public Privat Partnership Anti -Financial Crime Alliance (AFCA ) and is part of a taskforce covering among other topics human trafficking in the Europol Financial Intelligence Public Private Partnership (EFIPPP). In October 2022 the bank hosted an event organized by the Finance Against Slavery and Trafficking (FAST) i nitiative.
544;Deutsche_Bank_2022_EN;60;0;;;;;;;;;;;To reinforce employees’ awareness of activities linked to potential human rights violations the bank conducts periodic traini ngs. One specific example is a 45 -minute mandatory online course on anti -money laundering (AML) and the prevention of te rrorist and proliferation financing - topics that have potential connections to human rights violation. Every Deutsche Bank employee worldwide must complete the module once every year.
545;Deutsche_Bank_2022_EN;60;0;;;;;;;;;;;Around 99% of staff (including in- scope contingent workers) did so in 2022. Mandatory Risk Awareness training is also deployed to all staff every other year. This online training now includes a specifi c case on modern slavery in the private banking business and includes a question for learners on typical risk indicators.
546;Deutsche_Bank_2022_EN;60;0;;;;;;;;;;;Thi s updated course was launched in the fourth quarter of 2022 to English speaking staff and is going to be rolled out as translated versions in non -English speaking locations at the beginning of the second quarter 2023 . Supply chain GRI 2-6/25, 3-3 The produ cts and services that Deutsche Bank buys, who it buys from, and how it consumes has a significant influence on its sustainability footprint.
547;Deutsche_Bank_2022_EN;60;0;;;;;;;;;;;For this reason, sourcing and procurement activities play a key role in the bank’s ambitions to respect and improve human rights. While the divisions are accountable for the suppliers they use, the Global Procurement function leads on the vast majority of sourcing and procurement decisions.
548;Deutsche_Bank_2022_EN;60;0;;;;;;;;;;;In support of this, globally consistent processes and procedures are in place to govern the sourcing and procurement of goods and services, onboarding of suppliers and the ongoing management of supplier performance. Suppliers are required to meet a range of requirements including financial health, anti -fraud and corruption, and compliance checks to engage with Deutsche Bank .
549;Deutsche_Bank_2022_EN;60;0;;;;;;;;;;;Supplier Code of Conduct The intention of the Supplier Code of Conduct (“Code”) is that suppliers understand the core values and standards of behavior that Deutsche Bank expects its suppliers to conform to when providing goods and services.
550;Deutsche_Bank_2022_EN;60;0;;;;;;;;;;;The Code is acknowledged by the supplier responding to a request for proposal and on starting an engagement with Deutsche Bank, suppliers are expected to provide a copy of this Code to its personnel who will be involved in the supply of the goods and services. The Code contains sections on Compliance with Law, Human Rights, Diversity and Inclusion, Sustainability, and Corporate Social Responsibility. The Code is available on Deutsche Bank’s public supplier portal (*).
551;Deutsche_Bank_2022_EN;60;1;;;;;;;;;;;Screening of the bank’s vendors f or adequate social and environmental standards The bank undertakes the assessment of prospective vendors’ environmental and social standards starting with a questionnaire analyzing the significance of potential social or environmental impacts related to a vendor’s service delivery. Conditional on the results of this analysis, the vendor risk management process may further scrutinize the potential for sustainability risk s.
552;Deutsche_Bank_2022_EN;60;1;;;;;;;;;;;For vendors, with which Deutsche Bank spend more than € 500,000 annually vendor bala nced scorecards were launched. These scorecards evaluate vendors across a holistic set of key performance indicators. This evaluation includes a sustainability performance indicator which is either the rating score provided by EcoVadis or the vendor can us e an equivalent reputable sustainability rating agency.
553;Deutsche_Bank_2022_EN;60;1;;;;;;;;;;;From July 2022, the prerequisite for every new or prolonged contract worth more than € 500,000 a year is that the vendor has an external sustainability rating from EcoVadis or other rating agencies (*). To that end, the bank maintains a registration website (*) where vendors can obtain relevant information and start their assessments with the sustainability rating agency, EcoVadis.
554;Deutsche_Bank_2022_EN;61;0;;;;;;;;;;;60 Deutsche Bank Transition toward a sustainable and climate -neutral economy Non-Financial Report 2022 Human rights Meeting the requirements of the German Supply Chain Due Diligence Act, Deutsche Bank further enhanced and strengthened its procurement related human rights management processes. Based on a respective risk analysis, the bank adopted a risk management system targeted at minimizing human rights adverse imp acts across its supply chain.
555;Deutsche_Bank_2022_EN;61;0;;;;;;;;;;;In addition to the above requirements with regards to the submission of an external ESG rating, the bank enhanced preventive measures, including vendor due diligence, contract clauses according to vendors’ risk profile and sta ndardized processes for remedial action in case of actual human rights incidents in the bank’s supply chain.
556;Deutsche_Bank_2022_EN;61;0;;;;;;;;;;;The process for remedial actions is triggered by a variety of observations: incidents being flagged in Deutsche Bank’s risk review cycles, reported incidents through internal and external complaints channels, incidents being identified in adverse media monitoring and allegations directly reported to Deutsche Bank, e.g., by NGOs or media.
557;Deutsche_Bank_2022_EN;61;0;;;;;;;;;;;In such cases, the incidents will be further investigated and appropriate measures to remedy the adverse effects will be agreed with the vendor and monitored over time. The brand DWS is not covered by the management approach related to the German Supply Chain Due Diligence Act described in this section. Employees GRI 3-3, FS4 Deutsche Bank aims to be an ‘employer of choice’ for existing and future employees.
558;Deutsche_Bank_2022_EN;61;0;;;;;;;;;;;The bank strives to create a workplace that is both diverse and supportive and which is always welcoming of different views. The bank encourages high standards of conduct and work performance and is committed to providing a working environment free from harassment, discrimination and retaliation. Given the activities it undertakes and the geographies in which it operates, Deutsche Bank’s own operations have only li mited exposure to adverse impacts from human rights violations.
559;Deutsche_Bank_2022_EN;61;0;;;;;;;;;;;The bank aims to continue to monitor the safeguarding of human rights using a risk -based approach and focusing on those geographies where human rights issues are most likely to occur and where the bank has a material presence. Deutsche Bank is guided by the International Labour Organization Declaration on Fundamental Principles and Rights at Work as well as applicable labor laws in the different jurisdictions in which it operates.
560;Deutsche_Bank_2022_EN;61;0;;;;;;;;;;;This include s sovereign state legislation on collective agreements, bargaining and freedom of association. In countries where internationally recognized standards may not be fully implemented, the bank aims to honor the principles of internationally recognized human r ights. The bank expects all employees to understand their responsibilities and to act in accordance with its policies, procedures, and initiatives regarding human rights.
561;Deutsche_Bank_2022_EN;61;0;;;;;;;;;;;The bank reinforce s this awareness through bank -wide training. For example, 86.8% of employees completed training s on compliance and ethics that also include aspects of human rights in 202 2 (2021 excluding Postbank: 93.3%). The bank investigated all employee grievances reported to the integrity hotline in 202 2. If violations were identifie d, they were reported to the appropriate functions, and the necessary steps were taken.
562;Deutsche_Bank_2022_EN;62;0;;;;;;;;;;;61 Deutsche Bank Transition toward a sustainable and climate -neutral economy Non-Financial Report 2022 In-house ecology In-house ecology – On target to reduce energy consumption by 20% by 2025 – 95.
563;Deutsche_Bank_2022_EN;62;0;;;;;;;;;;;7% of all electricity from renewable sources GRI 3 -3 As part of Deutsche Bank’s commitment to being a responsible corporate citizen, the Group manages and, where possible, minimizes the actual negative environmental impact of business operations, such as the energy and resources used in offices and carbon em issions from business travel.
564;Deutsche_Bank_2022_EN;62;0;;;;;;;;;;;This is done by reducing energy consumption and using other resources as efficiently as possible, buying renewable electricit y, and offsetting the remaining emissions. After engaging with stakeholders internally, action was t aken to improve the quality of supply chain emissions data. To start to reduce the environmental impact of suppliers, the bank joined the CDP Supply Chain where members can engage with suppliers, identify risks and opportunities, and share carbon emissions data.
565;Deutsche_Bank_2022_EN;62;0;;;;;;;;;;;In 2022 Deutsche Bank requested its largest 147 vendors respond to the CDP climate change questionnaire to more fully understand and reduce the emissions associated with purchased goods and services. Of the 147 suppliers, 92 responded. In 2023 it is planned to expand this number to the largest 300 suppliers. The planned measure of effectiveness of this action is more suppliers disclosing emissions data to the CDP in 2023.
566;Deutsche_Bank_2022_EN;62;0;;;;;;;;;;;Finally, Deutsche Bank strives to use water and paper responsibly, reduce the a mount of waste generated, and re- use and recycle as much as possible. Governance GRI 2 -13, 3 -3 Deutsche Bank’s governance framework for collecting data on, quantifying, and reporting greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions is based on ISO 14064, an internationall y recognized standard for GHG reporting.
567;Deutsche_Bank_2022_EN;62;0;;;;;;;;;;;"In addition, the bank’s energy management system in Germany is certified to ISO 50001; this includes monitoring progress toward energy and cost reduction targets on a monthly and annual basis. Deutsche Bank complies with the European Energy Directive in the 20 EU countries where it operates, and base conservation efforts on the respective national energy audit requirements."
568;Deutsche_Bank_2022_EN;62;0;;;;;;;;;;;"The Eco -Performance Management Office (EcoPMO) in the Global Real Estate function oversees en ergy and resource conservation in offices and other facilities. It defines criteria and responsibilities for how energy conservation initiatives are evaluated and approved. Facility management teams complete an energy initiative assessment and implement energy and water efficiency projects; the EcoPMO measures and verifies outcomes."
569;Deutsche_Bank_2022_EN;62;0;;;;;;;;;;;In addition, progress toward targets is continually monitored by collecting data on energy use, water use, and waste at Deutsche Bank’s buildings. This information is collated in monthly regional energy reports, which are reviewed by regional and global division managers, and quarterly reviews are held with the Chief Sustainability Officer to inform about In -house ecology topics and performance against targets who in turn briefs the management board.
570;Deutsche_Bank_2022_EN;62;0;;;;;;;;;;;Deutsche Bank’s Scope 1 and Scope 2 emissions are calculated based on the reporting boundary of the GHG Protocol’s operational control approach. This report is the second consecutive year in which the relevant categories 1 to 14 of Deutsche Bank’s Scope 3 GHG emissions are disclosed.
571;Deutsche_Bank_2022_EN;62;1;;;;;;;;;;;– Scope 1: Direct emissions from on -site and mobile combustion (liquid/gaseous fossil fuels, owned and leased vehicles, and refrigerant leakage from cooling equipment) – Scope 2: Indirect emissions from delivered energy (electricity, district heating, steam, and ch illed water) – Scope 3: Relevant c ategories 1 to 14 (excluding investments or financed emissions).

575;Deutsche_Bank_2022_EN;63;0;;;;;;;;;;;This is achi eved by consuming less energy, traveling less, and purchasing more renewable electricity, and then finally by offsetting Deutsche Bank’s residual Scope 1 and 2 emissions as well as those associated with the Group’s business travel.
576;Deutsche_Bank_2022_EN;63;0;;;;;;;;;;;Market -based emissions from own operations and business travel (including the effect of buying renewable electricity) amounted to 74,300 metric tons of CO 2e in 2022, while emissions from own operations and business travel using location- based reporting (excluding renewables) tot aled 174,236 metric tons of CO 2e.
577;Deutsche_Bank_2022_EN;63;0;;;;;;;;;;;The difference between the two types of reporting is due to renewable electricity contracts or energy attribute certificates (EACs) purchased in 29 countries, particularly in three countries —Germany, the United Kingdom, an d the United States —where most electricity is consumed by the bank. Having reduced energy consumption and travel, and purchased renewable electricity for 95.
578;Deutsche_Bank_2022_EN;63;0;;;;;;;;;;;7 % of all electricity consumption, in 2022, Deutsche Bank continued to offset the residual emission s by purchasing and retiring high -quality Verified Emission Reduction (VER) certificates.

Paper consumption The production of paper consumes valuable resources.
624;Deutsche_Bank_2022_EN;67;1;;;;;;;;;;;The bank therefore works continually to use less paper, in part by introducing new technology.

630;Deutsche_Bank_2022_EN;68;0;;;;;;;;;;;Posters, e- mail banners, and the Global Real Estate intranet have promoted the initiative and educated staff on current challenges, such as the difficulty of recycling plastic due to poor segregation and the contamination of waste streams. Landfilled waste increased due to a new landlord in New York being unable to provide evidence of how the waste was treated, so a conservative approach was taken to assume none of the waste was recycled or incinerated.
631;Deutsche_Bank_2022_EN;68;0;;;;;;;;;;;Sig nificant changes in other waste disposal methods, other recovery methods, anaerobic digestion, and prepared for re- use, are due to the adoption of the new GRI waste standard in January 2022, and the limited availability of data for those categories in 2021 .

649;Deutsche_Bank_2022_EN;72;0;;;;;;;;;;;Its corporate g overnance therefore reflects the structure with three separate corporate bodies – Supervisory Board, Management Board, and Shareholders’ Meeting – stipulated by the Ge rman Stock Corporation Act (AktG). Each of these three corporate bodies has distinct responsibilities. The Supervisory Board appoints the members of the Management Board and monitors its activities.
650;Deutsche_Bank_2022_EN;72;0;;;;;;;;;;;The Management Board has overarching responsibility for m anaging Deutsche Bank AG, steering Deutsche Bank Group and setting the bank’s strategic course. The Shareholders’ Meeting appoints the shareholders’ representatives to the Supervisory Board and votes on certain matters established by law and the Company’s Articles of Association.
651;Deutsche_Bank_2022_EN;72;0;;;;;;;;;;;Given the corporate governance structure with its separation of the Management and Supervisory Board, a member of the Supervisory Board is excluded from being a member of the Management Board. The Supervisory Board consists of 20 members, 10 of whom are shareholder representatives elected by the Shareholders’ Meeting, 10 of whom are employee representatives.
652;Deutsche_Bank_2022_EN;72;0;;;;;;;;;;;Pursuant to the German Co -Determination Act (Mitbestimmungsgesetz), the employee representatives are elected by the Deutsche Bank AG’s employees in Germany. Unlike the Management Board, the Supervisory Board generally does not perform management functions or issue direct business instructions to the Management Board. However, it has the autho rity to subject certain of the Management Board’s decisions to a consent requirement.
653;Deutsche_Bank_2022_EN;72;0;;;;;;;;;;;Moreover, it, together with the Management Board, adopts Deutsche Bank AG’s annual financial statements, approves the Group’s annual financial statements and appoints the members of the Management Board.

The Deutsche Bank Supervisory Board has established the fol lowing nine committees consisting of subsets of its members and each with distinct tasks, as set forth in an abridged form below.
655;Deutsche_Bank_2022_EN;73;0;;;;;;;;;;;The detailed responsibilities are set out in the terms of reference of the respective committees with the exception of the Mediation Committee which is an ad hoc committee. The task to specifically advise and monitor the Management Board with regard to ESG issues, the definition of ESG strategies and their implementation has been moved from the former Integrity Committee (no w Regulatory Oversight Committee) to the bank’s Strategy and Sustainability Committee.
656;Deutsche_Bank_2022_EN;73;0;;;;;;;;;;;The Nomination Committee supports the Supervisory Board in identifying suitable candidates to fill positions on the Management Board, drawing up an objective to promote the representation of the underrepresented gender on the Supervisory Board and a strategy for achieving this. More information about Supervisory Board committees can be found in the bank’s Corporate Governance Statement 2022.
657;Deutsche_Bank_2022_EN;73;0;;;;;;;;;;;The Management Board is respon sible for managing Deutsche Bank AG in accordance with the law, the Company’s Articles of Association, and its terms of reference. It seeks to create sustainable value in the Company’s interests while taking into consideration the interests of shareholders , employees, and other stakeholders.
658;Deutsche_Bank_2022_EN;73;0;;;;;;;;;;;More specifically, the Management Board’s main responsibilities include establishing a proper and effective business organization, designing Deutsche Bank Group’s corporate strategy, and maintaining adequate risk govern ance (which includes appropriate and effective risk management), and complying with legal requirements and company policies. Management Board members are collectively responsible for managing Deutsche Bank AG. There may not be any reporting lines between them.
659;Deutsche_Bank_2022_EN;73;0;;;;;;;;;;;Notwithstanding the principle of collective responsibility, the Management Board’s business allocation plan has allocated individual members responsibility for specific functional area(s) and thus ensures segregation of duties within the whole organi zation up to the Management Board. Management Board members are responsible for delegating their duties to subordinate levels of hierarchy and for clearly assigning responsibilities within the functional area(s) for which they are responsible.
660;Deutsche_Bank_2022_EN;73;0;;;;;;;;;;;Such delegat ion is necessary for the proper functioning of the business organization and does not except Management Board members from adequately overseeing delegated duties and tasks. The business allocation plan has allocated responsibility for Sustainability to the Chief Executive Officer.
661;Deutsche_Bank_2022_EN;73;0;;;;;;;;;;;The Management Board has delegated it to the Chief Sustainability Officer, who is responsible for implementing the sustainability strategy of Deutsche Bank which is described i n more detail in the chapter Sustainability strategy and implementation. The Management Board prefers to rely on individually accountable senior managers rather than committees. It generally only establishes committees for issues that require collective decision -making.
662;Deutsche_Bank_2022_EN;73;0;;;;;;;;;;;For certain overarching topics the Management Board has established the following committees and has delegated certain decision- making authority to them for each of the following issues:.

665;Deutsche_Bank_2022_EN;74;0;;;;;;;;;;;The Corporate Governance Statement in the Annual Report 2022 contains more information about Management Board composition. Deutsche Bank consistently pursues the goal of being a role model for sustainability in the financial sector, thus contributing to a more environmentally compatible, socially responsible and better managed economy.
666;Deutsche_Bank_2022_EN;74;0;;;;;;;;;;;In order to closely and visibly link the sustainability strategy with the compensation of the Management Board, the Supervisory Board decided at an early stage to reflect the bank's strategic sustainable goals in the compensation system. Already since 2021, the Supervisory Board and Management Board have linked the variable compensation of t he bank’s top executives to additional financial and non- financial criteria from the areas of ESG.
667;Deutsche_Bank_2022_EN;74;0;;;;;;;;;;;This further developed system for the compensation of the members of the Management Board of Deutsche Bank, which was approved by the Annual General Meeting in 2021 with a majority of 97.76%, was also applied in 2022. The compensation system forms the basis for the Supervisory Board to determine each member of the Management Board's total compensation. The Supervisory Board is supported by the Compensation Control Committee.
668;Deutsche_Bank_2022_EN;74;0;;;;;;;;;;;Management Board members receive fixed and variable compensation components. The latter consists of two elements (short -term award and long-term award) and reflects the degree to which group, divisional, and individual objectives are achiev ed. Both awards are linked to several ESG targets. The aim is to closely align compensation with the bank´s sustainability strategy and performance. The ESG targets for the short -term award are contained in individual and divisional balanced scorecards.
669;Deutsche_Bank_2022_EN;74;0;;;;;;;;;;;They can also be part of a Management Board member’s individual targets agreed on at the beginning of a financial year. An ESG rating index representing a composite of five large rating agencies is also factored in. The ESG factor, which is the highest - weigh t factor in the long- term award, is assessed based on ESG objectives. These are related to impactful Group ESG focus topics that are the Management Board’s responsibility.
670;Deutsche_Bank_2022_EN;74;0;;;;;;;;;;;The objectives, which are transparently disclosed in the Management Compensation Rep ort include factors such as e.g., the amount of sustainable financing and investments, the reduction of electricity consumption in the bank’s buildings, concretely defined targets from the area of climate risk management as well as the improvement in gender diversity.
671;Deutsche_Bank_2022_EN;74;1;;;;;;;;;;;In addition, the objectives include employee feedback culture, as well as achievements and positive developments regarding the bank’s control environment and remediation activities.

Political discussions in the EU are dominated by the ambition to achieve “digital sovereignty”, manifesting in increasing scrutiny of cross -border data flows and non-EU service providers.
782;Deutsche_Bank_2022_EN;85;0;;;;;;;;;;;In 2022, the European Commission published a proposal for an EU -Data Act, with the aim of facilitat ing data access and sharing and set ting a general framework for sectoral data access obligations. This framework will provide the basis for potential future legislation on Open Finance. The EU-Data Act also introduces requirements for the switching of cloud services, to increase interoperability and address vendor lock- in.
783;Deutsche_Bank_2022_EN;85;0;;;;;;;;;;;In parallel, there is ongoing work on cybersecurity requirements for cloud services, following strict approaches towards the use of n on-European cloud service providers. The Council of the EU adopted the Digital Operational Resilience Act, which introduces a direct oversight regime for critical technology providers in November while the UK authorities (Bank of England, H is Majesty’s Tre asury and Financial Conduct Authority) published a discussion paper on Critical Third Parties in September.
784;Deutsche_Bank_2022_EN;85;0;;;;;;;;;;;The US Treasury is working on a report on cloud computing originally expected to be published before the end of 2022.

785;Deutsche_Bank_2022_EN;85;0;;;;;;;;;;;The emergence of crypt o assets and their use for investment and payment purposes required supervisors to provide targeted guidance for an ecosystem that lacks a robust legal basis and adequate consumer protection measures. In parallel, regulators across the globe review their f rameworks and, where appropriate, extend them to crypto assets. This became particular imminent in the course of numerous insolvency and fraud cases related to individual crypto assets or -platforms.
786;Deutsche_Bank_2022_EN;85;0;;;;;;;;;;;Whilst Deutsche Bank does not yet actively engage in any business models related to crypto assets , it closely follows the regulatory developments worldwide. In parallel, and in response to the progressing digitalization of the economies and societies and with a view to retaining th e sovereignty of their nation al currencies, 90% of the central banks globally are assessing or have assessed the feasibility of issuing central bank digital currencies as a new form of central bank money.
787;Deutsche_Bank_2022_EN;85;0;;;;;;;;;;;This has the potential to significantly change monetary systems and is therefore of key relevance for banks. Moreover, governments and central banks worldwide are focusing on increasing the use of real -time payments, increasing the supply of and access to payment services through innovative new solutions, as well as enhancing cross- border payments.
788;Deutsche_Bank_2022_EN;85;0;;;;;;;;;;;For example, the European Commission reviews the impact of the revised Payment Services Directive, in effect since 2018, and published a legislative proposal for instant payments in October 2022.

Unlike the U.S., the EU i ssued a draft directive to implement the OECD model rules on December 22, 2021, and the directive was adopted on December 15, 2022.
838;Deutsche_Bank_2022_EN;90;1;;;;;;;;;;;The provisions under the EU directive will need to be transposed into national law by Germany and the other EU member states and are expected to take effect beginning with tax year 2024. The bank’s in- house tax function has set up a working group to monitor developments and start assessing potential future implications and implementation efforts. Deutsche Bank is represented with its active subsidiaries and branches in almost 60 jurisdictions.
839;Deutsche_Bank_2022_EN;90;1;;;;;;;;;;;On a combined basis Deutsche Bank’s blended statutory tax rate across all these jurisdictions on average amounts to 28% to 30%, which is significantly higher than the contemplated minimum tax of 15%. Of the close to 60 countries, six apply a statutory tax rate of less than 15% to the bank’s operations. As of December 31, 2022, none of these countries are listed on the EU list of non - cooperative jurisdictions for tax purposes.
840;Deutsche_Bank_2022_EN;90;1;;;;;;;;;;;On February 14th, 2023, the Council of the EU added Russia to such list. The implications for Deutsche Bank and its Russian operations are currently under review. As a matter of principle, Deutsche Bank reports its profits in the countries in which they are generated, this means that profits are also taxed in those countries.

843;Deutsche_Bank_2022_EN;91;0;;;;;;;;;;;For information on the domicile of the companies, names and their primary activities please refer to the sharehol dings list (see Annual Report 2022, Note 44 – Shareholdings). The geographical location of subsidiaries and branches considers the country of incorporation or residence. To enhance the understanding of the Country by Country reporting the following explan atory information is provided .
844;Deutsche_Bank_2022_EN;91;0;;;;;;;;;;;The Country- by-Country information reported is derived from the IFRS Group accounts of Deutsche Bank. It is, however, not directly reconcilable to other financial information in the Annual Report because of specific guidance published by the Bundesbank on December 16, 2014, which includes the requirement to present the country information prior to the elimination of cross- border intragroup transactions.
845;Deutsche_Bank_2022_EN;91;0;;;;;;;;;;;In line with this requirement, only intragroup transactions withi n the same country are eliminated. As an example, the dividend income received by a group entity in Country X from a subsidiary in Country Y is not included in the IFRS Group accounts, as these are eliminated in consolidation. However, they are included in and reported in the results of Country X in the Country- by-Country reporting.
846;Deutsche_Bank_2022_EN;91;0;;;;;;;;;;;As a matter of principle such intra -group dividend income is generally tax -exempt in most jurisdictions to avoid double or multiple layers of taxation. Accordingly, these specif ic reporting requirements can have a significant impact on the jurisdictional effective tax rate shown in the Countr y-by-Country reporting, which may differ from the country’s statutory tax rate. Moreover, the disclosed income tax expense or benefit may al so reflect various other adjustments required by tax law, e.

Internationally it focuses on wealthy individuals, entrepreneurs and family associations, as well as small and medium -sized enterprises in selected European countries. Customer satisfaction is foremost measured on the basis of the Net Promoter Score (NPS), an internationally recognized metric.
909;Deutsche_Bank_2022_EN;97;1;;;;;;;;;;;The NPS measures the willingness of customers to recommend a company and the reasons for doing so. It is considered as an essential indicator of loyalty and satisfaction. This customer -centric approach increases transparency, both internally and externally.
910;Deutsche_Bank_2022_EN;97;1;;;;;;;;;;;At Private Bank Germany, a variety of methods is used to survey the NPS: On the one hand, customers are surveyed immediately after an interaction with a branch, after using selected online service or product completion routes or after an interaction with the call center. On the other hand, these surveys are supplemented by regular panel surveys of customers and non- customers to create an overall picture.
911;Deutsche_Bank_2022_EN;97;1;;;;;;;;;;;In 2022, the NPS was measured across the board in all 400 branches of the Deutsche Bank brand, in all seven regional advisory centers, in the call center as well as in digital channels for products that can be purchased online. For the Postbank brand, more than 200 out of a total of 650 branches were connected. Here, the nationwide implementation is aimed to be finished in 2023.
912;Deutsche_Bank_2022_EN;97;1;;;;;;;;;;;Initial results show that customers interacting with a branch or on multiple channels recommend the bank more likely than custom ers who rely exclusively on online and mobile banking. A survey of customer by age conducted in third quarter of 2022 showed that the NPS of customers aged 45 and above was slightly higher than of customers under 45. Across all distribution channels and cl ient’s segments, the NPS at Private Bank Germany was 65 after a contact with Deutsche Bank brand.
913;Deutsche_Bank_2022_EN;97;1;;;;;;;;;;;In 2022, more than 123,000 clients gave their feedback: 75% of the clients surveyed could be considered as so- called “promoters” who rated their willingness to recommend Deutsche Bank with nine or ten on a scale of zero to ten, 15% as “passive” who rate their readiness to recommend with a score of seven or eight and 10% were considered as “detractors” (with a score of 0- 6). For Postbank brand, the first values are planned to be reported after the further rollout of NPS in 2023.

917;Deutsche_Bank_2022_EN;98;0;;;;;;;;;;;International Private Bank Premium Banking includes retail and affluent customers as well as commercial banking clients (i.e. , all small business clients and small sized corporate clients that are not covered as part of the Bank for Entrepreneurs). International Private Bank uses both Net Promoter Score (NPS) and client satisfaction (CSAT) index metrics. In International Private Bank markets primarily focused on Wealth Management & Bank for Entrepreneurs, only Net Promoter Score is used.
918;Deutsche_Bank_2022_EN;98;0;;;;;;;;;;;Alongside Net Promoter Score, International Private Bank also compiles a client satisfaction (CSAT) index in Spain and Italy, focused primarily on Premium Banking clients. This broader index measures clients’ overall satisfaction with Deutsche Bank, including all the items that affect their relationship with the Bank.
919;Deutsche_Bank_2022_EN;98;0;;;;;;;;;;;As per previous years, the client satisfaction (CSAT) index and Net Promoter Scores were weighted based on the revenue contribution from the respective areas of the business, as opposed to the number of respondents to the survey, making it more representative of the business mix. Prior to 2022, within Wealth Management & Bank for Entrepreneurs, only Wealth Management Germany used the Net Promoter Score metho dology.
920;Deutsche_Bank_2022_EN;98;0;;;;;;;;;;;In 2022, Net Promoter Score methodology was rolled out across additional Wealth Management & Bank for Entrepreneurs markets to gain a global perspective. Therefore in 2022, Wealth Management & Bank for Entrepreneurs clients within the six Internati onal Private Bank reporting regions (Americas, APAC, EMEA, Germany, Italy and Spain) were sent online surveys to ascertain Net Promoter Score performance, rendering prior years data incomparable.
921;Deutsche_Bank_2022_EN;98;0;;;;;;;;;;;"Results show approximately 60% of clients globally are ""prom oters"" of the brand with an overall Net Promoter Score of 44.5 (without regional revenue weighting applied).

925;Deutsche_Bank_2022_EN;98;1;;;;;;;;;;;2 The gl obal Net Promoter Score (NPS) for Wealth Management and Bank for Entrepreneurs has been calculated by using regional NPS scor es, which have been adjusted to reflect regional -weighted revenue contribution across the six Wealth Management and Bank for Entrepreneurs regions. Due to Italy’s business mix, Wealth Management and Private Banking is reflected for Italy in this calculation.
926;Deutsche_Bank_2022_EN;98;1;;;;;;;;;;;3 Net Promoter Score (NPS) is shown for International Private Bank (IPB) Italy and Spain only (excluding Wealth Management and B ank for Entrepreneurs) reflected by revenue contribution which is 69% for Italy and 31% for Spain in 2022. In 2020 & 2021, NPS reporting for International Privat e Bank excluded Wealth Management. This metric is reported here again in 2022, however in line with new client segmentation, this now reflects the Premium Banking segment, which excludes Consumer Finance.
927;Deutsche_Bank_2022_EN;98;1;;;;;;;;;;;4 In 2022, Net Promoter Score (NPS) surveys for the Wealth Management and Bank for Entrepreneurs segment were primarily conduct ed by online methodologies. In 2020, the client satisfaction (CSAT) scores and findings in Italy were primarily based on telephone interviews. In 2021, the process for Italy was amended to broaden the calculation base and also include online respondents. In 2022, Italy and S pain used both telephone and online survey methodologies.
928;Deutsche_Bank_2022_EN;98;1;;;;;;;;;;;In addition, I nternational Private Bank used mystery shopper interactions to check that its advisory processes meet its clients’ needs.

Further policies and procedures at country and/or divisional level supplement the global standards as required.
935;Deutsche_Bank_2022_EN;99;0;;;;;;;;;;;The global policy and procedure comply with the “Guidelines for complaints- handling for the securities (European Securities and Markets Authority) and banking (European Banking Authority) sectors,” as jointly issued by the Europeans Securities and Markets Authority (ESMA) and the European Banking Authority (EBA) and with their interpretation by the German Federal Financial Supervisory Authority (Bundesanstalt für Finanzdienstleistungsaufsicht, BaFin).
936;Deutsche_Bank_2022_EN;99;0;;;;;;;;;;;Their objective s are to set global minimum standards for handling complaints and to ensure that all locations, branches, and subsidiaries handle and resolve complaints impartially and without undue delay. It applies to all business divisions and supporting infrastructure functions (together Units). All Units are responsible for implementing the global policy and the global procedure respectively. As a matter of principle, Deutsche Bank strives to prevent complaints from arising.
937;Deutsche_Bank_2022_EN;99;0;;;;;;;;;;;The bank does this by aspiring to address challenges before they arise. If this is not possible, the bank seeks to contact complainants (clients and non -clients) and reach a solution at the first contact. Complainants can address their complaints in any local branch, by email, online, or phone, and through authorized third parties. Deutsche Bank strives to confirm receipt of complaints as soon as possible and to work on resolving them quickly and transparently.
938;Deutsche_Bank_2022_EN;99;1;;;;;;;;;;;Furthermore, the bank continuously monitors complaints to detect emerging trends and to i dentify the root causes.

1097;Deutsche_Bank_2022_EN;116;0;;;;;;;;;;;The survey measures key indicators, such as commitment (degree of pride and motivation as employees, willingness to recommend the bank to friends and family), enablement (degree of productivity in their role, its challenge and interest to them, and whether they have the right skills, tools, and resources to perform it well), and engagement with the bank’s val ues (familiarity with the values and the behaviors that contribute to a productive environment).
1098;Deutsche_Bank_2022_EN;116;0;;;;;;;;;;;The survey also addresses strategically important issues, such as active and visible leadership and the bank’s ethics, conduct, and S peak -Up Culture. The People Survey contains four questions about the frequency and quality of upward and downward feedback, team meetings, and appreciation with results consistently showing that regular conversations (once a month or more frequently) make a positive difference in employees ’ motivation and perceived productivity.
1099;Deutsche_Bank_2022_EN;116;0;;;;;;;;;;;Since 2020 these four questions have been asked in a quarterly survey to provide for a feedback culture KPI, which is reported to the Management Board.
