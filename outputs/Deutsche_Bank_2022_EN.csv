All of these developments have once again made us aware of the wide range of risks we are exposed to – as an economy and society as a whole, but also each company individually. For us at Deutsche Bank, robust and comprehensive risk management is a cornerstone of our business. This has long since encompassed more than credit, market and other financial risks.

If we do not systematically address the threats posed by climate change or increasing financial crime, we are putting the very basis of our business at risk. It is essential that we do everything in our power to further tighten our controls. This is also a key element in living up to our claim to be at the center of society.

It does not help anyone if we as a bank reduce our own carbon footprint but fail to make the world any cleaner as a result. There is more progress to report.

In 2022, for example, we increased our Anti -Financial Crime department by more than 340 to over 1,900 employees, and in mid- 2022 Management Board member Stefan Simon took over as a member of the Board of the Anti -Financial Crime Alliance (AFCA)..

To entrench a strong risk culture, Deutsche Bank encourages everyone to speak out when something doesn't seem right. This “Speak -Up Culture” is what we expect. Another important aspect of a strong risk culture is that our bank can meet the requirement to record business- related communications. As such, our employees are only permitted to use approved communication channels, and Deutsche Bank has further strengthened its processes and controls here.

This transformation, which the Supervisory Board has continuously supported, has been successfully executed. As a result of the realignment, the bank has regained credibility and confidence , as I learned from numerous discussions with clients, employees, investors, supervisors and politicians since I took office.
